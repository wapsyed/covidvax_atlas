Systems biology approaches have been used to determine signatures that can be used to predict vaccine-induced immunity in humans, but whether there is a 'universal signature' that can be used to predict antibody responses to any vaccine is unknown. Here we did systems analyses of immune responses to the polysaccharide and conjugate vaccines against meningococcus in healthy adults, in the broader context of published studies of vaccines against yellow fever virus and influenza virus. To achieve this, we did a large-scale network integration of publicly available human blood transcriptomes and systems-scale databases in specific biological contexts and deduced a set of transcription modules in blood. Those modules revealed distinct transcriptional signatures of antibody responses to different classes of vaccines, which provided key insights into primary viral, protein recall and anti-polysaccharide responses.

Twelve capsular groups of meningococci are known, and quadrivalent vaccines against four of these (A, C, W and Y) are available as plain-polysaccharide and protein-polysaccharide conjugate vaccines. Here we apply contemporary methods to describe B-cell responses to meningococcal polysaccharide and conjugate vaccines. METHODS: Twenty adults were randomly assigned to receive either a meningococcal plain-polysaccharide or conjugate vaccine; one month later all received the conjugate vaccine. Blood samples were taken pre-vaccination and 7, 21 and 28 days after vaccination; B-cell responses were assessed by ELISpot, serum bactericidal assay, flow cytometry and gene expression microarray. RESULTS: Seven days after an initial dose of either vaccine, a gene expression signature characteristic of plasmablasts was detectable. The frequency of newly generated plasma cells (CXCR3<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>+</sup>) and the expression of transcripts derived from IGKC and IGHG2 correlated with immunogenicity. Notably, using an independent dataset, the expression of glucosamine (N-acetyl)-6-sulfatase was found to reproducibly correlate with the magnitude of immune response. Transcriptomic and flow cytometric data revealed depletion of switched memory B cells following plain-polysaccharide vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: These data describe distinct gene signatures associated with the production of high-avidity antibody and a plain-polysaccharide-specific signature, possibly linked to polysaccharide-induced hyporesponsiveness.","Genes down-regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cell 7d after second dose vs 7d after first dose in adult (30-70) after exposure to Menveo/ACWYVax , time point 7D.

The aim of this study was to demonstrate the immunological feasibility of neonatal pneumococcal conjugate vaccination (PCV) which could potentially protect high-risk infants in resource poor countries against severe pneumococcal disease and mortality in the early critical period of life. Papua New Guinean infants were randomized to be vaccinated with the 7-valent PCV (7vPCV) at birth, 1 and 2 months (neonatal group, n=104) or at 1, 2 and 3 months of age (infant group, n=105), or to not receive 7vPCV at all (control group, n=109). Analysis of vaccine responses at 3 and 9 months of age demonstrated persistently higher type-1 (IFN-gamma) and type-2 (IL-5 and IL-13) T-cell responses to the protein carrier CRM(197) and IgG antibody titres to 7vPCV serotypes in children vaccinated with 7vPCV according to either schedule as compared to unvaccinated children. In a comprehensive immuno-phenotypic analysis at 9 months of age, no differences in the quantity or quality of vaccine-specific T cell memory responses were found between neonatal vaccinations versus children given their first PCV dose at one month.

The aim of this study was to demonstrate the immunological feasibility of neonatal pneumococcal conjugate vaccination (PCV) which could potentially protect high-risk infants in resource poor countries against severe pneumococcal disease and mortality in the early critical period of life. Papua New Guinean infants were randomized to be vaccinated with the 7-valent PCV (7vPCV) at birth, 1 and 2 months (neonatal group, n=104) or at 1, 2 and 3 months of age (infant group, n=105), or to not receive 7vPCV at all (control group, n=109). Analysis of vaccine responses at 3 and 9 months of age demonstrated persistently higher type-1 (IFN-gamma) and type-2 (IL-5 and IL-13) T-cell responses to the protein carrier CRM(197) and IgG antibody titres to 7vPCV serotypes in children vaccinated with 7vPCV according to either schedule as compared to unvaccinated children. In a comprehensive immuno-phenotypic analysis at 9 months of age, no differences in the quantity or quality of vaccine-specific T cell memory responses were found between neonatal vaccinations versus children given their first PCV dose at one month. Hospitalization rates in the first month of life did not differ between children vaccinated with PCV at birth or not. These findings demonstrate that neonatal 7vPCV vaccination is safe and not associated with immunological tolerance.

METHODS: Using ribonucleic acid sequencing on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from AS03-adjuvanted and unadjuvanted inactivated H5N1 vaccine recipients, we identified differentially expressed genes, enriched pathways, and genes that correlated with serologic responses. We compared bulk PBMC findings with our previously published assessments of flow-sorted immune cell types. RESULTS: AS03-adjuvanted vaccine induced the strongest differential signals on day 1 postvaccination, activating multiple innate immune pathways including interferon and JAK-STAT signaling, Fcgamma receptor (FcgammaR)-mediated phagocytosis, and antigen processing and presentation. Changes in signal transduction and immunoglobulin genes predicted peak hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) titers. Compared with individual immune cell types, activated PBMC genes and pathways were most similar to innate immune cells. However, several pathways were unique to PBMCs, and several pathways identified in individual cell types were absent in PBMCs. CONCLUSIONS: Transcriptomic analysis of PBMCs after AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 vaccination revealed early activation of innate immune signaling, including a 5- to 8-fold upregulation of Fc-gammaR1A/1B/1C genes. Several early gene responses were correlated with HAI titer, indicating links with the adaptive immune response. Although PBMCs and cell-specific results shared key innate immune signals, unique signals were identified by both approaches.","Genes down-regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cell vaccinated with AS03 adjuvant vs phosphate-bufferred saline in adults (19-39) after exposure to inactivated monovalent influenza A/Indonesia/05/2005 H5N1 split-virus vaccine , time point 1D , administered i.m.","Howard LM,Goll JB,Jensen TL,Hoek KL,Prasad N,Gelber CE,Levy SE,Joyce S,Link AJ,Creech CB,Edwards KM",30566602,HUMAN_GENE_SYMBOL,"ADAMTS7,ATG9B,ATP13A4,KCNJ5-AS1,LINC00612,HEATR9,C2orf27A,CACNA1I,CHD5,COL5A1,COL5A3,CYP4F12,DPEP3,FXYD2,GSDMA,HSPG2,IL23R,LMO7-AS1,MFGE8,MIR635,MMP15,NDRG4,NOG,NRCAM,OCM,SHANK1,SPRY1,SPRY2,STYK1,SYT17,TNNC1,TPBG,TRBJ2-4,TRIM74,ZNF890P",35,"ADAMTS7,ATG9B,ATP13A4,C11orf45,C12orf33,C17orf66,C2orf27A,CACNA1I,CHD5,COL5A1,COL5A3,CYP4F12,DPEP3,FXYD2,GSDMA,HSPG2,IL23R,LMO7-AS1,MFGE8,MIR635,MMP15,NDRG4,NOG,NRCAM,OCM,SHANK1,SPRY1,SPRY2,STYK1,SYT17,TNNC1,TPBG,TRBJ2-4,TRIM74,ZNF890P",C7:VAX,HIPC SIGNATURES,NIAID/HIPC SIGNATURES,Table 2,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5133148/table/T2/,NA,NA,NA,NA

PBMCs obtained prior to vaccination (Day 0) and at day 2 or 4, day 7 and day 28 post-vaccine were subjected to gene expression microarray analysis. We defined a response signature and also detected induction of a type I interferon response at day 2 and a plasma cell signature at day 7 post-vaccine in young responders. The response signature was dysregulated in older adults, with the plasma cell signature induced at day 2, and was never induced in frail subjects (who were all non-responders). We also identified a mitochondrial signature in young vaccine responders containing genes mediating mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation that was consistent in two different vaccine seasons and verified by analyses of mitochondrial content and protein expression. These results represent the first genome-wide transcriptional profiling analysis of age-associated dynamics following influenza vaccination, and implicate changes in mitochondrial biogenesis and function as a critical factor in human vaccine responsiveness.","Genes up-regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cell young adults vs seniors in young adults (21-30), seniors (70+) after exposure to Inactivated influenza vaccine , time point 0D","Thakar J,Mohanty S,West AP,Joshi SR,Ueda I,Wilson J,Meng H,Blevins TP,Tsang S,Trentalange M,Siconolfi B,Park K,Gill TM,Belshe RB,Kaech SM,Shadel GS,Kleinstein SH,Shaw AC",25596819,HUMAN_GENE_SYMBOL,"AAK1,AGAP4,ALDOB,ARRDC5,CD248,CSAD,EP300,FCGBP,GTPBP3,IQSEC1,LINC01089,,LRRN3,NAA16,NPIPA1,NPIPB15,NSUN5P1,PDE7A,PPTC7,RAI1,SNORD4A,SREBF1,TUT4",23,"AAK1,AGAP4,ALDOB,ARRDC5,CD248,CSAD,EP300,FCGBP,GTPBP3,IQSEC1,LINC01089,LOC100190986,LRRN3,NARG1L,NPIP,NPIPB15,NSUN5B,PDE7A,PPTC7,RAI1,SNORD4A,SREBF1,ZCCHC11",C7:VAX,HIPC SIGNATURES,NIAID/HIPC SIGNATURES,Supplementary Table 2a: TIV-Monocytes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3140559/bin/NIHMS301940-supplement-3.xlsx,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here we applied systems approaches to investigate the innate and adaptive responses to trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) and MF59-adjuvanted TIV (ATIV) in 90 14- to 24-mo-old healthy children. MF59 enhanced the magnitude and kinetics of serum antibody titers following vaccination, and induced a greater frequency of vaccine specific, multicytokine-producing CD4(+) T cells. Compared with transcriptional responses to TIV vaccination previously reported in adults, responses to TIV in infants were markedly attenuated, limited to genes regulating antiviral and antigen presentation pathways, and observed only in a subset of vaccinees. In contrast, transcriptional responses to ATIV boost were more homogenous and robust. Interestingly, a day 1 gene signature characteristic of the innate response (antiviral IFN genes, dendritic cell, and monocyte responses) correlated with hemagglutination at day 28. These findings demonstrate that MF59 enhances the magnitude, kinetics, and consistency of the innate and adaptive response to vaccination with the seasonal influenza vaccine during early childhood, and identify potential molecular correlates of antibody responses.","Genes positively correlated with HAI response in peripheral blood mononuclear cell in children (14-27m) (MF59-adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted) after exposure to Fluad/Imuvac , time point 1D.

However, great interindividual variability exists in vaccine responses, the cellular events that take place in vivo after vaccination are poorly understood, and appropriate biomarkers for vaccine responsiveness have not been developed. METHODS: We immunized a cohort of healthy male adults with a licensed trivalent influenza vaccine and performed a timed assessment of global gene expression before and after vaccination. We analyzed the relationship between gene expression patterns and the humoral immune response to vaccination. RESULTS: Marked up regulation of expression of genes involved in interferon signaling, positive IL-6 regulation, and antigen processing and presentation, were detected within 24 hours of immunization. The late vaccine response showed a transcriptional pattern suggestive of increased protein biosynthesis and cellular proliferation. Integrative analyses revealed a 494-gene expression signature--including STAT1, CD74, and E2F2--which strongly correlates with the magnitude of the antibody response. High vaccine responder status correlates with increased early expression of interferon signaling and antigen processing and presentation genes. CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the role of a systems biology approach in understanding the molecular events that take place in vivo after influenza vaccination and in the development of better predictors of vaccine responsiveness.","Genes positively correlated with titer response index in peripheral blood mononuclear cell in Caucasian male adults (18-40) (high responders) after exposure to Fluarix/Fluvirin , time point 1D and 3DY.

We studied healthy adults vaccinated with trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) or live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). TIV induced higher antibody titers and more plasmablasts than LAIV did. In subjects vaccinated with TIV, early molecular signatures correlated with and could be used to accurately predict later antibody titers in two independent trials. Notably, expression of the kinase CaMKIV at day 3 was inversely correlated with later antibody titers. Vaccination of CaMKIV-deficient mice with TIV induced enhanced antigen-specific antibody titers, which demonstrated an unappreciated role for CaMKIV in the regulation of antibody responses. Thus, systems approaches can be used to predict immunogenicity and provide new mechanistic insights about vaccines.","Genes negatively correlated with HAI response at 28d in peripheral blood mononuclear cell in adults (18-50) after exposure to Fluarix/Fluvirin , time point 3D.

We studied healthy adults vaccinated with trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) or live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). TIV induced higher antibody titers and more plasmablasts than LAIV did. In subjects vaccinated with TIV, early molecular signatures correlated with and could be used to accurately predict later antibody titers in two independent trials. Notably, expression of the kinase CaMKIV at day 3 was inversely correlated with later antibody titers. Vaccination of CaMKIV-deficient mice with TIV induced enhanced antigen-specific antibody titers, which demonstrated an unappreciated role for CaMKIV in the regulation of antibody responses. Thus, systems approaches can be used to predict immunogenicity and provide new mechanistic insights about vaccines.","Genes positively correlated with HAI response at 28d in peripheral blood mononuclear cell in adults (18-50) after exposure to Fluarix/Fluvirin , time point 3D.

We carried out an integrative, longitudinal study combining genetic, transcriptional, and immunologic data in humans given seasonal influenza vaccine. We identified 20 genes exhibiting a transcriptional response to vaccination, significant genotype effects on gene expression, and correlation between the transcriptional and antibody responses. The results show that variation at the level of genes involved in membrane trafficking and antigen processing significantly influences the human response to influenza vaccination. More broadly, we demonstrate that an integrative study design is an efficient alternative to existing methods for the identification of genes involved in complex traits.

We studied healthy adults vaccinated with trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) or live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). TIV induced higher antibody titers and more plasmablasts than LAIV did. In subjects vaccinated with TIV, early molecular signatures correlated with and could be used to accurately predict later antibody titers in two independent trials. Notably, expression of the kinase CaMKIV at day 3 was inversely correlated with later antibody titers. Vaccination of CaMKIV-deficient mice with TIV induced enhanced antigen-specific antibody titers, which demonstrated an unappreciated role for CaMKIV in the regulation of antibody responses. Thus, systems approaches can be used to predict immunogenicity and provide new mechanistic insights about vaccines.","Genes negatively correlated with HAI response at 28d in peripheral blood mononuclear cell in adults (18-50) after exposure to Fluarix/Fluvirin , time point 7D.

The aim of this study was to identify baseline, early and late blood transcriptional signatures (in peripheral blood mononuclear cells/PBMCs) associated with memory B cell response following influenza vaccination. METHODS: We used pre- and post-vaccination mRNA-Seq transcriptional profiling on samples from 159 subjects (50-74years old) following receipt of seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine containing the A/California/7/2009/H1N1-like virus, and penalized regression modeling to identify associations with influenza A/H1N1-specific memory B cell ELISPOT response after vaccination. RESULTS: Genesets and genes (p-value range 7.92E(-08) to 0.00018, q-value range 0.00019-0.039) demonstrating significant associations (of gene expression levels) with memory B cell response suggest the importance of metabolic (cholesterol and lipid metabolism-related), cell migration/adhesion, MAP kinase, NF-kB cell signaling (chemokine/cytokine signaling) and transcriptional regulation gene signatures in the development of memory B cell response after influenza vaccination. CONCLUSION: Through an unbiased transcriptome-wide profiling approach, our study identified signatures of memory B cell response following influenza vaccination, highlighting the underappreciated role

Here we applied systems approaches to investigate the innate and adaptive responses to trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) and MF59-adjuvanted TIV (ATIV) in 90 14- to 24-mo-old healthy children. MF59 enhanced the magnitude and kinetics of serum antibody titers following vaccination, and induced a greater frequency of vaccine specific, multicytokine-producing CD4(+) T cells. Compared with transcriptional responses to TIV vaccination previously reported in adults, responses to TIV in infants were markedly attenuated, limited to genes regulating antiviral and antigen presentation pathways, and observed only in a subset of vaccinees. In contrast, transcriptional responses to ATIV boost were more homogenous and robust. Interestingly, a day 1 gene signature characteristic of the innate response (antiviral IFN genes, dendritic cell, and monocyte responses) correlated with hemagglutination at day 28. These findings demonstrate that MF59 enhances the magnitude, kinetics, and consistency of the innate and adaptive response to vaccination with the seasonal influenza vaccine during early childhood, and identify potential molecular correlates of antibody responses.","Genes up-regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cell 1d postboost vs 0d pre-imm in children (14-27m) after exposure to Imuvac , time point 1D.

Here we applied systems approaches to investigate the innate and adaptive responses to trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) and MF59-adjuvanted TIV (ATIV) in 90 14- to 24-mo-old healthy children. MF59 enhanced the magnitude and kinetics of serum antibody titers following vaccination, and induced a greater frequency of vaccine specific, multicytokine-producing CD4(+) T cells. Compared with transcriptional responses to TIV vaccination previously reported in adults, responses to TIV in infants were markedly attenuated, limited to genes regulating antiviral and antigen presentation pathways, and observed only in a subset of vaccinees. In contrast, transcriptional responses to ATIV boost were more homogenous and robust. Interestingly, a day 1 gene signature characteristic of the innate response (antiviral IFN genes, dendritic cell, and monocyte responses) correlated with hemagglutination at day 28. These findings demonstrate that MF59 enhances the magnitude, kinetics, and consistency of the innate and adaptive response to vaccination with the seasonal influenza vaccine during early childhood, and identify potential molecular correlates of antibody responses.","Genes up-regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cell 1d postboost vs 0d pre-imm in children (14-27m) (MF59-adjuvanted) after exposure to Fluad , time point 1D.

Constructing such models requires the collection of dense measurements of system states, yet transformation of data into predictive constructs remains a challenge. To begin to model human immunity, we analyzed immune parameters in depth both at baseline and in response to influenza vaccination. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell transcriptomes, serum titers, cell subpopulation frequencies, and B cell responses were assessed in 63 individuals before and after vaccination and were used to develop a systematic framework to dissect inter- and intra-individual variation and build predictive models of postvaccination antibody responses. Strikingly, independent of age and pre-existing antibody titers, accurate models could be constructed using pre-perturbation cell populations alone, which were validated using independent baseline time points. Most of the parameters contributing to prediction delineated temporally stable baseline differences across individuals, raising the prospect of immune monitoring before intervention.","Genes positively correlated with cell frequency CD27hi CD38hi of CD20- B cells (Plasmablasts) and CD38+ of IgD-CD27+ memory B cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cell in adults after exposure to Fluvirin/Pandemrix , time point 7D","Tsang JS,Schwartzberg PL,Kotliarov Y,Biancotto A,Xie Z,Germain RN,Wang E,Olnes MJ,Narayanan M,Golding H,Moir S,Dickler HB,Perl S,Cheung F,Baylor HIPC Center,CHI Consortium",24725414,HUMAN_GENE_SYMBOL,"APOBEC3B,ARHGAP42,B4GALT3,BHLHE41,BUB1,CAV1,CCNA2,CCNB2,CD38,CDK1,CHAC2,CHEK1,DENND5B,DIPK1A,DLGAP5,DTL,ELL2,ERLEC1,FBXO16,FBH1,FBXO5,GLCCI1,GPRC5D,H1-5,H2BC14,H3C12,HSP90B1,HSPA13,HSPA5,IGHV4OR15-8,JCHAIN,IGKC,IGKV4-1,IRF4,ITM2C,KCNN3,KIF11,KLHL14,LMAN1,MAGED1,MAN1A1,MANEA,MEI1,MKI67,MTDH,MYO1D,NT5DC2,PARM1,PBK,PCLAF,PDIA4,PHGDH,PIM2,PLAAT2,PLK1,PLPP5,RAB30,RGS13,RRM2,SEC11C,SEC24A,SEL1L3,SHCBP1,SLC44A1,SPATS2,SPCS3,SUB1,TNFRSF17,TOP2A,TP53INP1,TPD52,TRAM2,TSHR,TYMS,UAP1,UBE2J1,XBP1,ZBP1",78,"APOBEC3B,ARHGAP42,B4GALT3,BHLHE41,BUB1,CAV1,CCNA2,CCNB2,CD38,CDK1,CHAC2,CHEK1,DENND5B,DIPK1A,DLGAP5,DTL,ELL2,ERLEC1,FBXO16,FBXO18,FBXO5,GLCCI1,GPRC5D,H1-5,H2BC14,H3C12,HSP90B1,HSPA13,HSPA5,IGHV4OR15-8,IGJ,IGKC,IGKV4-1,IRF4,ITM2C,KCNN3,KIF11,KLHL14,LMAN1,MAGED1,MAN1A1,MANEA,MEI1,MKI67,MTDH,MYO1D,NT5DC2,PARM1,PBK,PCLAF,PDIA4,PHGDH,PIM2,PLAAT2,PLK1,PLPP5,RAB30,RGS13,RRM2,SEC11C,SEC24A,SEL1L3,SHCBP1,SLC44A1,SPATS2,SPCS3,SUB1,TNFRSF17,TOP2A,TP53INP1,TPD52,TRAM2,TSHR,TYMS,UAP1,UBE2J1,XBP1,ZBP1",C7:VAX,HIPC SIGNATURES,NIAID/HIPC SIGNATURES,Table 1,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4987012/table/pone.0160970.t001/,NA,NA,NA,NA

The aim of this study was to identify baseline, early and late blood transcriptional signatures (in peripheral blood mononuclear cells/PBMCs) associated with memory B cell response following influenza vaccination. METHODS: We used pre- and post-vaccination mRNA-Seq transcriptional profiling on samples from 159 subjects (50-74years old) following receipt of seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine containing the A/California/7/2009/H1N1-like virus, and penalized regression modeling to identify associations with influenza A/H1N1-specific memory B cell ELISPOT response after vaccination. RESULTS: Genesets and genes (p-value range 7.92E(-08) to 0.00018, q-value range 0.00019-0.039) demonstrating significant associations (of gene expression levels) with memory B cell response suggest the importance of metabolic (cholesterol and lipid metabolism-related), cell migration/adhesion, MAP kinase, NF-kB cell signaling (chemokine/cytokine signaling) and transcriptional regulation gene signatures in the development of memory B cell response after influenza vaccination. CONCLUSION: Through an unbiased transcriptome-wide profiling approach, our study identified signatures of memory B cell response following influenza vaccination, highlighting the underappreciated role of metabolic changes (among the other immune function-related events) in the regulation of influenza vaccine-induced immune memory.","Genes positively correlated with memory B cell response at 28d in

We enrolled 158 older subjects who received the 2010-2011 trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine. Influenza-specific HAI and VNA titers and mRNA-sequencing were performed using blood samples obtained at Days 0, 3 and 28 post vaccination. For antibody response at Day 28 versus Day 0, several gene sets were identified as significant in predictive models for HAI (n=7) and VNA (n=35) responses. Five gene sets (comprising the genes MAZ, TTF, GSTM, RABGGTA, SMS, CA, IFNG and DOPEY) were in common for both HAI and VNA. For response at Day 28 versus Day 3, many gene sets were identified in predictive models for HAI (n=13) and VNA (n=41). Ten gene sets (comprising biologically related genes, such as MAN1B1, POLL, CEBPG, FOXP3, IL12A, TLR3, TLR7 and others) were shared between HAI and VNA. These identified gene sets demonstrated a high degree of network interactions and likelihood for functional relationships. Influenza-specific HAI and VNA responses demonstrated a remarkable degree of similarity. Although unique gene set signatures were identified for each humoral outcome, several gene sets were determined to be in common with both HAI and VNA response to influenza vaccine.","Genes down-regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cell 28d vs 0d in adults (50-74) (in common with both HAI and VNA) after exposure to Fluarix , time point 28D , administered i.m..

METHODS: We used pre- and post-vaccination mRNA-Seq transcriptional profiling on samples from 159 subjects (50-74years old) following receipt of seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine containing the A/California/7/2009/H1N1-like virus, and penalized regression modeling to identify associations with influenza A/H1N1-specific memory B cell ELISPOT response after vaccination. RESULTS: Genesets and genes (p-value range 7.92E(-08) to 0.00018, q-value range 0.00019-0.039) demonstrating significant associations (of gene expression levels) with memory B cell response suggest the importance of metabolic (cholesterol and lipid metabolism-related), cell migration/adhesion, MAP kinase, NF-kB cell signaling (chemokine/cytokine signaling) and transcriptional regulation gene signatures in the development of memory B cell response after influenza vaccination.

The aim of this study was to identify baseline, early and late blood transcriptional signatures (in peripheral blood mononuclear cells/PBMCs) associated with memory B cell response following influenza vaccination. METHODS: We used pre- and post-vaccination mRNA-Seq transcriptional profiling on samples from 159 subjects (50-74years old) following receipt of seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine containing the A/California/7/2009/H1N1-like virus, and penalized regression modeling to identify associations with influenza A/H1N1-specific memory B cell ELISPOT response after vaccination. RESULTS: Genesets and genes (p-value range 7.92E(-08) to 0.00018, q-value range 0.00019-0.039) demonstrating significant associations (of gene expression levels) with memory B cell response suggest the importance of metabolic (cholesterol and lipid metabolism-related), cell migration/adhesion, MAP kinase, NF-kB cell signaling (chemokine/cytokine signaling) and transcriptional regulation gene signatures in the development of memory B cell response after influenza vaccination. CONCLUSION: Through an unbiased transcriptome-wide profiling approach, our study identified signatures of memory B cell response following influenza vaccination, highlighting the underappreciated role of metabolic changes (among the other immune function-related events) in the regulation of influenza vaccine-induced immune memory.","Genes negatively correlated with memory B cell response in peripheral blood mononuclear cell in adults (50-74) after exposure to trivalent inactivated vaccine (A/California/7/09 (H1N1,), A/Perth /16/2009 (H3N2), and B/Brisbane/60/2008). , time point 28D.

METHODS: We analyzed the differences in B-cell responses and transcriptional profiles in children aged 6 months to 14 years immunized with these 2 vaccines. RESULTS: LAIV elicited a significant increase in naive, memory, and transitional B cells on day 30 after vaccination, whereas TIV elicited an increased number of plasmablasts on day 7. Antibody titers against the 3 vaccine strains (H1N1, H3N2, and B) were significantly higher in the TIV group and correlated with number of antibody-secreting cells. Both vaccines induced overexpression of interferon (IFN)-signaling genes but with different kinetics. TIV induced expression of IFN genes on day 1 after vaccination in all age groups, and LAIV induced expression of IFN genes on day 7 after vaccination but only in children < 5 years old. IFN-related genes overexpressed in both vaccinated groups correlated with H3N2 antibody titers. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that LAIV and TIV induced significantly different B-cell responses in vaccinated children. Early induction of IFN appears to be important for development of antibody responses.","Genes positively correlated with H3N1 HI titer in blood in children (0.5-14y) after exposure to Fluzone , time point 1D.

Here we show that within 24 h of receiving adjuvanted swine flu vaccine, healthy individuals made expansive, complex molecular and cellular responses that included overt lymphoid as well as myeloid contributions. Unexpectedly, this early response was subtly but significantly different in people older than ~35 years. Wide-ranging adverse clinical events can seriously confound vaccine adoption, but whether there are immunological correlates of these is unknown. Here we identify a molecular signature of adverse events that was commonly associated with an existing B cell phenotype.

Potential mechanisms for sex effects were identified in four gene clusters related to T, NK, and B cells. Mediation analysis indicated that sex-dependent expression in T and NK cell genes can be partially attributed to higher CD4+ T cell and lower NK cell fractions in females. We identified strong sex effects in 135 B cell genes whose expression correlates with ELISPOT measures, and found that cell subset differences did not explain the effect of sex on these genes' expression. Post-vaccination expression of these genes, however, mediated 41% of the sex effect on ELISPOT responses. <b>Conclusions:</b> These results improve our understanding of sexual dimorphism in immunity and influenza vaccine response.","Genes up-regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cell females vs males in adults (50-74) (females) after exposure to Fluarix , time point 0D, 3DY, 28D.

However, great interindividual variability exists in vaccine responses, the cellular events that take place in vivo after vaccination are poorly understood, and appropriate biomarkers for vaccine responsiveness have not been developed. METHODS: We immunized a cohort of healthy male adults with a licensed trivalent influenza vaccine and performed a timed assessment of global gene expression before and after vaccination. We analyzed the relationship between gene expression patterns and the humoral immune response to vaccination. RESULTS: Marked up regulation of expression of genes involved in interferon signaling, positive IL-6 regulation, and antigen processing and presentation, were detected within 24 hours of immunization. The late vaccine response showed a transcriptional pattern suggestive of increased protein biosynthesis and cellular proliferation. Integrative analyses revealed a 494-gene expression signature--including STAT1, CD74, and E2F2--which strongly correlates with the magnitude of the antibody response. High vaccine responder status correlates with increased early expression of interferon signaling and antigen processing and presentation genes. CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the role of a systems biology approach in understanding the molecular events that take place in vivo after influenza vaccination and in the development of better predictors of vaccine responsiveness.","Genes positively correlated with titer response index in peripheral blood mononuclear cell in Caucasian male adults (18-40) (low responders) after exposure to Fluarix/Fluvirin , time point 1D.

PBMCs obtained prior to vaccination (Day 0) and at day 2 or 4, day 7 and day 28 post-vaccine were subjected to gene expression microarray analysis. We defined a response signature and also detected induction of a type I interferon response at day 2 and a plasma cell signature at day 7 post-vaccine in young responders. The response signature was dysregulated in older adults, with the plasma cell signature induced at day 2, and was never induced in frail subjects (who were all non-responders). We also identified a mitochondrial signature in young vaccine responders containing genes mediating mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation that was consistent in two different vaccine seasons and verified by analyses of mitochondrial content and protein expression. These results represent the first genome-wide transcriptional profiling analysis of age-associated dynamics following influenza vaccination, and implicate changes in mitochondrial biogenesis and function as a critical factor in human vaccine responsiveness.","Genes down-regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cell 7d vs 0d in young adults (21-30) (responders) after exposure to Inactivated influenza vaccine , time point 7D.

PBMCs obtained prior to vaccination (Day 0) and at day 2 or 4, day 7 and day 28 post-vaccine were subjected to gene expression microarray analysis. We defined a response signature and also detected induction of a type I interferon response at day 2 and a plasma cell signature at day 7 post-vaccine in young responders. The response signature was dysregulated in older adults, with the plasma cell signature induced at day 2, and was never induced in frail subjects (who were all non-responders). We also identified a mitochondrial signature in young vaccine responders containing genes mediating mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation that was consistent in two different vaccine seasons and verified by analyses of mitochondrial content and protein expression. These results represent the first genome-wide transcriptional profiling analysis of age-associated dynamics following influenza vaccination, and implicate changes in mitochondrial biogenesis and function as a critical factor in human vaccine responsiveness.","Genes up-regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cell 28d vs 0d in young adults (21-30) (responders) after exposure to Inactivated

PBMCs obtained prior to vaccination (Day 0) and at day 2 or 4, day 7 and day 28 post-vaccine were subjected to gene expression microarray analysis. We defined a response signature and also detected induction of a type I interferon response at day 2 and a plasma cell signature at day 7 post-vaccine in young responders. The response signature was dysregulated in older adults, with the plasma cell signature induced at day 2, and was never induced in frail subjects (who were all non-responders). We also identified a mitochondrial signature in young vaccine responders containing genes mediating mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation that was consistent in two different vaccine seasons and verified by analyses of mitochondrial content and protein expression. These results represent the first genome-wide transcriptional profiling analysis of age-associated dynamics following influenza vaccination, and implicate changes in mitochondrial biogenesis and function as a critical factor in human vaccine responsiveness.","Genes up-regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cell 7d vs 0d in young adults (21-30) (responders) after exposure to Inactivated

Influenza-specific antibody (HAI) titer in serum samples and next-generation sequencing on PBMCs were performed using blood samples collected prior to (Day 0) and at two timepoints after (Days 3 and 28) vaccination. We identified a number of uncharacterized genes (ZNF300, NUP1333, KLK1 and others) and confirmed previous studies demonstrating specific genes/genesets that are important mediators of host immune responses and that displayed associations with antibody response to influenza A/H1N1 vaccine. These included interferon-regulatory transcription factors (IRF1/IRF2/IRF6/IRF7/IRF9), chemokine/chemokine receptors (CCR5/CCR9/CCL5), cytokine/cytokine receptors (IFNG/IL10RA/TNFRSF1A), protein kinases (MAP2K4/MAPK3), growth factor receptor (TGFBR1).

However, great interindividual variability exists in vaccine responses, the cellular events that take place in vivo after vaccination are poorly understood, and appropriate biomarkers for vaccine responsiveness have not been developed. METHODS: We immunized a cohort of healthy male adults with a licensed trivalent influenza vaccine and performed a timed assessment of global gene expression before and after vaccination. We analyzed the relationship between gene expression patterns and the humoral immune response to vaccination. RESULTS: Marked up regulation of expression of genes involved in interferon signaling, positive IL-6 regulation, and antigen processing and presentation, were detected within 24 hours of immunization. The late vaccine response showed a transcriptional pattern suggestive of increased protein biosynthesis and cellular proliferation. Integrative analyses revealed a 494-gene expression signature--including STAT1, CD74, and E2F2--which strongly correlates with the magnitude of the antibody response. High vaccine responder status correlates with increased early expression of interferon signaling and antigen processing and presentation genes. CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the role of a systems biology approach in understanding the molecular events that take place in vivo after influenza vaccination and in the development of better predictors of vaccine responsiveness.","Genes positively correlated with a functional network in peripheral blood mononuclear cell in Caucasian male adults (18-40) (high responders) after exposure to Fluarix/Fluvirin , time point 1D.

Adjuvant System 03 (AS03) markedly enhances immune responses to H5N1 vaccine antigens, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood. OBJECTIVE: We compared the safety (primary endpoint), immunogenicity (secondary), gene expression (tertiary) and cytokine responses (exploratory) between AS03-adjuvanted and unadjuvanted inactivated split-virus H5N1 influenza vaccines. In a double-blinded clinical trial, we randomized twenty adults aged 18-49 to receive two doses of either AS03-adjuvanted (n = 10) or unadjuvanted (n = 10) H5N1 vaccine 28 days apart. We used a systems biology approach to characterize and correlate changes in serum cytokines, antibody titers, and gene expression levels in six immune cell types at 1, 3, 7, and 28 days after the first vaccination. RESULTS: Both vaccines were well-tolerated. Nine of 10 subjects in the adjuvanted group and 0/10 in the unadjuvanted group exhibited seroprotection (hemagglutination inhibition antibody titer > 1:40) at day 56. Within 24 hours of AS03-adjuvanted vaccination, increased serum levels of IL-6 and IP-10 were noted. Interferon signaling and antigen processing and presentation-related gene responses were induced in dendritic cells, monocytes, and neutrophils. Upregulation of MHC class II antigen presentation-related genes was seen in neutrophils. Three days after AS03-adjuvanted vaccine, upregulation of genes involved in cell cycle and division was detected in NK cells and correlated with serum levels of IP-10. Early upregulation of interferon signaling-related genes was also found to predict seroprotection 56 days after first vaccination.

We used a systems biology approach to characterize and correlate changes in serum cytokines, antibody titers, and gene expression levels in six immune cell types at 1, 3, 7, and 28 days after the first vaccination. RESULTS: Both vaccines were well-tolerated. Nine of 10 subjects in the adjuvanted group and 0/10 in the unadjuvanted group exhibited seroprotection (hemagglutination inhibition antibody titer > 1:40) at day 56.

Within 24 hours of AS03-adjuvanted vaccination, increased serum levels of IL-6 and IP-10 were noted. Interferon signaling and antigen processing and presentation-related gene responses were induced in dendritic cells, monocytes, and neutrophils. Upregulation of MHC class II antigen presentation-related genes was seen in neutrophils. Three days after AS03-adjuvanted vaccine, upregulation of genes involved in cell cycle and division was detected in NK cells and correlated with serum levels of IP-10. Early upregulation of interferon signaling-related genes was also found to predict seroprotection 56 days after first vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Using this cell-based systems approach, novel mechanisms of action for AS03-adjuvanted pandemic influenza vaccination were observed.

Adjuvant System 03 (AS03) markedly enhances immune responses to H5N1 vaccine antigens, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood. OBJECTIVE: We compared the safety (primary endpoint), immunogenicity (secondary), gene expression (tertiary) and cytokine responses (exploratory) between AS03-adjuvanted and unadjuvanted inactivated split-virus H5N1 influenza vaccines. In a double-blinded clinical trial, we randomized twenty adults aged 18-49 to receive two doses of either AS03-adjuvanted (n = 10) or unadjuvanted (n = 10) H5N1 vaccine 28 days apart. We used a systems biology approach to characterize and correlate changes in serum cytokines, antibody titers, and gene expression levels in six immune cell types at 1, 3, 7, and 28 days after the first vaccination. RESULTS: Both vaccines were well-tolerated. Nine of 10 subjects in the adjuvanted group and 0/10 in the unadjuvanted group exhibited seroprotection (hemagglutination inhibition antibody titer > 1:40) at day 56. Within 24 hours of AS03-adjuvanted vaccination, increased serum levels of IL-6 and IP-10 were noted. Interferon signaling and antigen processing and presentation-related gene responses were induced in dendritic cells, monocytes, and neutrophils. Upregulation of MHC class II antigen presentation-related genes was seen in neutrophils. Three days after AS03-adjuvanted vaccine, upregulation of genes involved in cell cycle and division was detected in NK cells and correlated with serum levels of IP-10. Early upregulation of interferon signaling-related genes was also found to predict seroprotection 56 days after first vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Using this cell-based systems approach, novel mechanisms of action for AS03-adjuvanted pandemic influenza vaccination were observed.

We studied healthy adults vaccinated with trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) or live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). TIV induced higher antibody titers and more plasmablasts than LAIV did. In subjects vaccinated with TIV, early molecular signatures correlated with and could be used to accurately predict later antibody titers in two independent trials. Notably, expression of the kinase CaMKIV at day 3 was inversely correlated with later antibody titers. Vaccination of CaMKIV-deficient mice with TIV induced enhanced antigen-specific antibody titers, which demonstrated an unappreciated role for CaMKIV in the regulation of antibody responses. Thus, systems approaches can be used to predict immunogenicity and provide new mechanistic insights about vaccines.","Genes up-regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cell 3d vs 0d in adults (18-50) after exposure to Fluarix/Fluvirin , time point 3D.

The results showed that despite both vaccines elicited similar levels of anti-H1N1 antibodies at day30 after vaccination, higher reactivity was observed in AV at day180. While AV induced early changes in cell-surface molecules on monocytes, CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells and B-cells, NAV triggered minor changes, starting later on at day3. Furthermore, AV induced a late and persistent increase in TLR gene expression after day3, except for tlr4, while NAV displayed earlier but transient tlr3/4/7/9 up-regulation. Contrasting with NAV, prominent chemokine gene expression (cxcl8,cxcl9,ccl5) and a broad spectrum up-regulation of plasmatic biomarkers (CXCL8,IL-6,IL-1beta,IL-12,IL-10) was evident in AV, which showed a major involvement of TNF and IL-10. Similarly, AV induced a robust IL-10-modulated proinflammatory storm, with early and persistent involvement of TNF-alpha/IL-12/IFN-gamma axis derived from NK-cells, CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells along with promiscuous production of IL-4/IL-5/IL-13. Conversely, NAV promotes a concise and restricted intracytoplasmic chemokine/cytokine response, essentially mediated by TNF-alpha and IL-4, with late IL-10 production by CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells. Systems biology approach underscored that AV guided the formation of an imbricate network characterized by a progressive increase in the number of neighborhood connections amongst innate and adaptive immunity. In AV, the early cross-talk between innate and adaptive immunity, followed by the triad NK/CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells at day3, sponsored a later/robust biomarker network. These findings indicate the relevance of adjuvanted vaccination to orchestrate broad, balanced and multifactorial cellular immune events that lead ultimately to a stronger H1N1 humoral immunity.","Genes up-regulated in blood 3d vs 0d in adults (21-51) after exposure to Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Monovalent Vaccine (Sanofi Pasteur) , time point 3D , administered i.m.","Giarola-Silva S,Coelho-Dos-Reis JGA,Mourão MM,Campi-Azevedo AC,Nakagaki Silva EE,Luiza-Silva M,Martins MA,Silveira-Cassette ACO,Batista MA,Peruhype-Magalhães V,Antonelli LRDV,Leite Ribeiro JG,Elói-Santos SM,Machado AV,Teixeira-Carvalho A,Martins-Filho OA,Araújo MSS",28549970,HUMAN_GENE_SYMBOL,"IFNG,TLR3,TLR4,TLR7,TLR9",5,"IFNG,TLR3,TLR4,TLR7,TLR9",C7:VAX,HIPC SIGNATURES,NIAID/HIPC SIGNATURES,Fig 3: Adjuvanted,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354217300098?via%3Dihub#fig3,NA,NA,NA,NA

Most published systems vaccinology studies have utilized whole blood or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to monitor the immune response after vaccination. Because human blood is comprised of multiple hematopoietic cell types, the potential for masking responses of under-represented cell populations is increased when analyzing whole blood or PBMC. To investigate the contribution of individual cell types to the immune response after vaccination, we established a rapid and efficient method to purify human T and B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, myeloid dendritic cells (mDC), monocytes, and neutrophils from fresh venous blood. Purified cells were fractionated and processed in a single day. RNA-Seq and quantitative shotgun proteomics were performed to determine expression profiles for each cell type prior to and after inactivated seasonal influenza vaccination. Our results show that transcriptomic and proteomic profiles generated from purified immune cells differ significantly from PBMC. Differential expression analysis for each immune cell type also shows unique transcriptomic and proteomic expression profiles as well as changing biological networks at early time points after vaccination.

To investigate the contribution of individual cell types to the immune response after vaccination, we established a rapid and efficient method to purify human T and B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, myeloid dendritic cells (mDC), monocytes, and neutrophils from fresh venous blood. Purified cells were fractionated and processed in a single day. RNA-Seq and quantitative shotgun proteomics were performed to determine expression profiles for each cell type prior to and after inactivated seasonal influenza vaccination. Our results show that transcriptomic and proteomic profiles generated from purified immune cells differ significantly from PBMC. Differential expression analysis for each immune cell type also shows unique transcriptomic and proteomic expression profiles as well as changing biological networks at early time points after vaccination.

Adjuvant System 03 (AS03) markedly enhances immune responses to H5N1 vaccine antigens, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood. OBJECTIVE: We compared the safety (primary endpoint), immunogenicity (secondary), gene expression (tertiary) and cytokine responses (exploratory) between AS03-adjuvanted and unadjuvanted inactivated split-virus H5N1 influenza vaccines. In a double-blinded clinical trial, we randomized twenty adults aged 18-49 to receive two doses of either AS03-adjuvanted (n = 10) or unadjuvanted (n = 10) H5N1 vaccine 28 days apart. We used a systems biology approach to characterize and correlate changes in serum cytokines, antibody titers, and gene expression levels in six immune cell types at 1, 3, 7, and 28 days after the first vaccination. RESULTS: Both vaccines were well-tolerated. Nine of 10 subjects in the adjuvanted group and 0/10 in the unadjuvanted group exhibited seroprotection (hemagglutination inhibition antibody titer > 1:40) at day 56. Within 24 hours of AS03-adjuvanted vaccination, increased serum levels of IL-6 and IP-10 were noted. Interferon signaling and antigen processing and presentation-related gene responses were induced in dendritic cells, monocytes, and neutrophils. Upregulation of MHC class II antigen presentation-related genes was seen in neutrophils. Three days after AS03-adjuvanted vaccine, upregulation of genes involved in cell cycle and division was detected in NK cells and correlated with serum levels of IP-10. Early upregulation of interferon signaling-related genes was also found to predict seroprotection 56 days after first vaccination.

The results showed that despite both vaccines elicited similar levels of anti-H1N1 antibodies at day30 after vaccination, higher reactivity was observed in AV at day180. While AV induced early changes in cell-surface molecules on monocytes, CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells and B-cells, NAV triggered minor changes, starting later on at day3. Furthermore, AV induced a late and persistent increase in TLR gene expression after day3, except for tlr4, while NAV displayed earlier but transient tlr3/4/7/9 up-regulation. Contrasting with NAV, prominent chemokine gene expression (cxcl8,cxcl9,ccl5) and a broad spectrum up-regulation of plasmatic biomarkers (CXCL8,IL-6,IL-1beta,IL-12,IL-10) was evident in AV, which showed a major involvement of TNF and IL-10. Similarly, AV induced a robust IL-10-modulated proinflammatory storm, with early and persistent involvement of TNF-alpha/IL-12/IFN-gamma axis derived from NK-cells, CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells along with promiscuous production of IL-4/IL-5/IL-13. Conversely, NAV promotes a concise and restricted intracytoplasmic chemokine/cytokine response, essentially mediated by TNF-alpha and IL-4, with late IL-10 production by CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells.

We studied healthy adults vaccinated with trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) or live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). TIV induced higher antibody titers and more plasmablasts than LAIV did. In subjects vaccinated with TIV, early molecular signatures correlated with and could be used to accurately predict later antibody titers in two independent trials. Notably, expression of the kinase CaMKIV at day 3 was inversely correlated with later antibody titers. Vaccination of CaMKIV-deficient mice with TIV induced enhanced antigen-specific antibody titers, which demonstrated an unappreciated role for CaMKIV in the regulation of antibody responses. Thus, systems approaches can be used to predict immunogenicity and provide new mechanistic insights about vaccines.","Genes up-regulated in monocyte 7d vs 0d in young adults (18-50) after exposure to

We studied healthy adults vaccinated with trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) or live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). TIV induced higher antibody titers and more plasmablasts than LAIV did. In subjects vaccinated with TIV, early molecular signatures correlated with and could be used to accurately predict later antibody titers in two independent trials. Notably, expression of the kinase CaMKIV at day 3 was inversely correlated with later antibody titers. Vaccination of CaMKIV-deficient mice with TIV induced enhanced antigen-specific antibody titers, which demonstrated an unappreciated role for CaMKIV in the regulation of antibody responses. Thus, systems approaches can be used to predict immunogenicity and provide new mechanistic insights about vaccines.","Genes up-regulated in plasmacytoid dendritic cell 7d vs 0d in young adults (18-50) after exposure to Fluarix/Fluvirin , time point 7D","Nakaya HI,Wrammert J,Lee EK,Racioppi L,Marie-Kunze S,Haining WN,Means AR,Kasturi SP,Khan N,Li GM,McCausland M,Kanchan V,Kokko KE,Li S,Elbein R,Mehta AK,Aderem A,Subbarao K,Ahmed R,Pulendran B",21743478,HUMAN_GENE_SYMBOL,"ADAM28,ADCK2,TLE5,AIFM1,,AKAP6,ALDH5A1,AMMECR1,APAF1,APEX2,APLP2,ARIH1,ARNT,ARRB2,ATF7IP,ATP10A,ATP5MC2,BACH1,BAX,BLVRA,BRD3OS,TMEM260,SZRD1,CALML4,CAMSAP1,CARD8,CBLB,CCNA2,CD180,CD22,CD40,CD69,CD86,CDC25A,CDC42EP3,CDHR5,CENPO,CEP135,CFLAR,CLUAP1,CNOT4,COL9A3,COTL1,CRABP2,CRIM1,CTSO,CTSZ,DEDD,DHX34,DHX40,DLG1,DNAJB6,DPP4,VPS26C,EEA1,EGR1,EIF4A1,ELP4,EPB41L3,EYA3,F11R,TASOR,DENND10,FAR2,FEM1B,FOXO3,TIMM10B,GABBR1,GABPB1,GADD45B,GGPS1,GLO1,GNL3L,GOLGA2,GPR52,HBS1L,HECTD3,HEXIM1,HGSNAT,HIPK3,H2AC18,H2AC19,HSD17B8,,IGHA1,IGHA2,IGHD,IGHG1,IGHG3,IGHG4,IGHM,IGHV3-23,IL10RB,IL6R,IPCEF1,IPO5,IQGAP1,IRF3,ISG20L2,ITSN2,JUN,KDM5B,KIF2A,KLF9,KLHL28,KPNA6,KRAS,KRT86,KYNU,LAIR1,LGALS8,LILRA1,LIMK2,LPIN1,LRRC37A2,MAP3K7,MARCKS,MEF2C,MRPS18C,MTAP,MTSS1,MYC,NCOR1,NEAT1,NIPBL,NMB,NOLC1,NRP1,NTM,OAS3,PAK2,PALM2AKAP2,PCBP2,PDE4DIP,PFN2,PIH1D1,PLBD1,PMAIP1,POLR2A,POM121,POM121C,PPIA,PRKCA,PRPF4B,PSEN1,PSME3,PTGS2,PTK2,PTPN12,RABGGTB,RAD21,RALBP1,RALGAPB,RASA2,RBM12B,RBMX,RGPD5,RGPD6,RGPD8,RHOB,RHOQ,RRP9,S100A2,SAR1A,SCO2,SEC14L1,SF1,SRSF11,SCAF11,SFSWAP,SIGLEC6,SIK3,SLC12A3,SLC17A5,SLC2A14,SLC2A3,SLC35D1,SLC4A7,SMAD2,SNX27,SP4,SPEN,SRRT,STX11,STX16,STX17,STX5,SULT1A1,SULT1A3,SULT1A4,TAOK3,TCOF1,TFDP2,THBS1,TIMP2,TLE4,TMCC1,TMEM135,TMPO,TMUB2,TNFRSF10B,TNFSF12-TNFSF13,TNFSF13,TNIP1,TNPO2,TP53I3,TRIM33,TRPS1,UBA7,UBXN4,WASHC4,WDFY3,WSB1,ZBED4,ZFP36L1,ZGPAT,ZMAT3,ZMYND8,ZNF148,ZPR1,ZNF593",221,"ADAM28,ADCK2,AES,AIFM1,AKAP2,AKAP6,ALDH5A1,AMMECR1,APAF1,APEX2,APLP2,ARIH1,ARNT,ARRB2,ATF7IP,ATP10A,ATP5G2,BACH1,BAX,BLVRA,BRD3OS,C14orf101,C1orf144,CALML4,CAMSAP1,CARD8,CBLB,CCNA2,CD180,CD22,CD40,CD69,CD86,CDC25A,CDC42EP3,CDHR5,CENPO,CEP135,CFLAR,CLUAP1,CNOT4,COL9A3,COTL1,CRABP2,CRIM1,CTSO,CTSZ,DEDD,DHX34,DHX40,DLG1,DNAJB6,DPP4,DSCR3,EEA1,EGR1,EIF4A1,ELP4,EPB41L3,EYA3,F11R,FAM208A,FAM45A,FAR2,FEM1B,FOXO3,FXC1,GABBR1,GABPB1,GADD45B,GGPS1,GLO1,GNL3L,GOLGA2,GPR52,HBS1L,HECTD3,HEXIM1,HGSNAT,HIPK3,HIST2H2AA3,HIST2H2AA4,HSD17B8,IGH,IGHA1,IGHA2,IGHD,IGHG1,IGHG3,IGHG4,IGHM,IGHV3-23,IL10RB,IL6R,IPCEF1,IPO5,IQGAP1,IRF3,ISG20L2,ITSN2,JUN,KDM5B,KIF2A,KLF9,KLHL28,KPNA6,KRAS,KRT86,KYNU,LAIR1,LGALS8,LILRA1,LIMK2,LPIN1,LRRC37A2,MAP3K7,MARCKS,MEF2C,MRPS18C,MTAP,MTSS1,MYC,NCOR1,NEAT1,NIPBL,NMB,NOLC1,NRP1,NTM,OAS3,PAK2,PALM2-AKAP2,PCBP2,PDE4DIP,PFN2,PIH1D1,PLBD1,PMAIP1,POLR2A,POM121,POM121C,PPIA,PRKCA,PRPF4B,PSEN1,PSME3,PTGS2,PTK2,PTPN12,RABGGTB,RAD21,RALBP1,RALGAPB,RASA2,RBM12B,RBMX,RGPD5,RGPD6,RGPD8,RHOB,RHOQ,RRP9,S100A2,SAR1A,SCO2,SEC14L1,SF1,SFRS11,SFRS2IP,SFRS8,SIGLEC6,SIK3,SLC12A3,SLC17A5,SLC2A14,SLC2A3,SLC35D1,SLC4A7,SMAD2,SNX27,SP4,SPEN,SRRT,STX11,STX16,STX17,STX5,SULT1A1,SULT1A3,SULT1A4,TAOK3,TCOF1,TFDP2,THBS1,TIMP2,TLE4,TMCC1,TMEM135,TMPO,TMUB2,TNFRSF10B,TNFSF12-TNFSF13,TNFSF13,TNIP1,TNPO2,TP53I3,TRIM33,TRPS1,UBA7,UBXN4,WASHC4,WDFY3,WSB1,ZBED4,ZFP36L1,ZGPAT,ZMAT3,ZMYND8,ZNF148,ZNF259,ZNF593",C7:VAX,HIPC SIGNATURES,NIAID/HIPC SIGNATURES,S6 Dataset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4338067/bin/pone.0118528.s006.xlsx,NA,NA,NA,NA

Most published systems vaccinology studies have utilized whole blood or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to monitor the immune response after vaccination. Because human blood is comprised of multiple hematopoietic cell types, the potential for masking responses of under-represented cell populations is increased when analyzing whole blood or PBMC. To investigate the contribution of individual cell types to the immune response after vaccination, we established a rapid and efficient method to purify human T and B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, myeloid dendritic cells (mDC), monocytes, and neutrophils from fresh venous blood. Purified cells were fractionated and processed in a single day. RNA-Seq and quantitative shotgun proteomics were performed to determine expression profiles for each cell type prior to and after inactivated seasonal influenza vaccination.

To investigate the contribution of individual cell types to the immune response after vaccination, we established a rapid and efficient method to purify human T and B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, myeloid dendritic cells (mDC), monocytes, and neutrophils from fresh venous blood. Purified cells were fractionated and processed in a single day. RNA-Seq and quantitative shotgun proteomics were performed to determine expression profiles for each cell type prior to and after inactivated seasonal influenza vaccination. Our results show that transcriptomic and proteomic profiles generated from purified immune cells differ significantly from PBMC. Differential expression analysis for each immune cell type also shows unique transcriptomic and proteomic expression profiles as well as changing biological networks at early time points after vaccination. This cell type-specific information provides a more comprehensive approach to monitor vaccine responses.","Genes up-regulated in natural killer cell 7d vs 0d in adults after exposure to 2011-2012 trivalent inactivated vaccine (A/California/7/09 (H1N1), A/Perth /16/2009 (H3N2), B/Brisbane/60/2008) , time point 7D.

PBMCs obtained prior to vaccination (Day 0) and at day 2 or 4, day 7 and day 28 post-vaccine were subjected to gene expression microarray analysis. We defined a response signature and also detected induction of a type I interferon response at day 2 and a plasma cell signature at day 7 post-vaccine in young responders. The response signature was dysregulated in older adults, with the plasma cell signature induced at day 2, and was never induced in frail subjects (who were all non-responders). We also identified a mitochondrial signature in young vaccine responders containing genes mediating mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation that was consistent in two different vaccine seasons and verified by analyses of mitochondrial content and protein expression. These results represent the first genome-wide transcriptional profiling analysis of age-associated dynamics following influenza vaccination, and implicate changes in mitochondrial biogenesis and function as a critical factor in human vaccine responsiveness.","Genes up-regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cell seniors vs young adults in seniors (70+), young adults (21-30) after exposure to Inactivated influenza vaccine , time point 0D","Thakar J,Mohanty S,West AP,Joshi SR,Ueda I,Wilson J,Meng H,Blevins TP,Tsang S,Trentalange M,Siconolfi B,Park K,Gill TM,Belshe RB,Kaech SM,Shadel GS,Kleinstein SH,Shaw AC",25596819,HUMAN_GENE_SYMBOL,"ARL6IP1,GBP5,ITGB1,LPAR6,REEP5",5,"ARL6IP1,GBP5,ITGB1,LPAR6,REEP5",C7:VAX,HIPC SIGNATURES,NIAID/HIPC SIGNATURES,s4_tcl_d1,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5242433/bin/pone.0167488.s005.xlsx,NA,NA,NA,NA

To better understand this difference, this study compared the mRNA sequencing transcription profile (RNA seq) in children who received either IIV or LAIV. METHODS: Children 3-17years of age receiving quadrivalent influenza vaccine were enrolled. Blood samples were collected on Day 0 prior to vaccination and again on Day 7 (range 6-10days) following vaccination. Total RNA was isolated from PAXgene tubes and sequenced for a custom panel of 89 transcripts using the TruSeq Targeted RNA Expression method. Fold differences in normalized RNA seq counts from Day 0 to Day 7 were calculated, log<sub>2</sub> transformed and compared between the two vaccine groups. RESULTS: Of 72 children, 46 received IIV and 26 received LAIV. Following IIV vaccination, 7 genes demonstrated significant differential expression at Day 7 (down-regulated). In contrast, following LAIV vaccination, 8 genes demonstrated significant differential expression at Day 7 (5 up-regulated and 3 down-regulated). Only two genes demonstrated similar patterns of regulation in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Differential regulation of genes was observed between 2015-16 LAIV and IIV recipients.

RESULTS: LAIV elicited a significant increase in naive, memory, and transitional B cells on day 30 after vaccination, whereas TIV elicited an increased number of plasmablasts on day 7. Antibody titers against the 3 vaccine strains (H1N1, H3N2, and B) were significantly higher in the TIV group and correlated with number of antibody-secreting cells. Both vaccines induced overexpression of interferon (IFN)-signaling genes but with different kinetics.

METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, dose-escalation trial in HIV-negative, healthy adult, BCG-naÃ¯ve volunteers, negative for prior exposure to Mtb, at one US clinical site. Volunteers were randomized 2:1 at each dose level to receive a single intradermal dose of AERAS-422 ( > 10(5)- < 10(6)CFU=low dose, â‰¥10(6)- < 10(7)CFU=high dose) or non-recombinant Tice BCG (1-8Ã—10(5)CFU). Randomization used an independently prepared randomly generated sequence of treatment assignments. The primary and secondary outcomes were safety and immunogenicity, respectively, assessed in all participants through 182days post-vaccination. ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT01340820. FINDINGS: Between Nov 2010 and Aug 2011, 24 volunteers were enrolled (AERAS-422 high dose, n=8; AERAS-422 low dose, n=8; Tice BCG, n=8); all were included in the safety and immunogenicity analyses. All 24 subjects had at least one adverse event, primarily expected local reactions. High dose AERAS-422 vaccination induced Ag85A- and Ag85B-specific lymphoproliferative responses and marked anti-mycobacterial activity in a whole blood bactericidal activity culture assay (WBA), but was associated with varicella zoster virus (VZV) reactivation in two vaccinees. These volunteers displayed high BCG-specific IFN-Î³ responses pre- and post-vaccination possibly predisposing them to autocrine/paracrine negative regulation of immune control of latent VZV. A systems biology transcriptomal approach identified positive correlations between post-vaccination T cell expression modules and WBA, and negative correlations between post-vaccination monocyte expression modules and WBA. The expression of one key macrophage marker (F4/80) was constitutively elevated in the two volunteers with zoster. INTERPRETATION: The unexpected development of VZV in two of eight healthy adult vaccine recipients resulted in discontinuation of AERAS-422 vaccine development. Immunological and transcriptomal data identified correlations with the development of TB immunity and VZV that require further investigation.

To decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying variable vaccine responses, T- and B-cell responses to VZV vaccination were examined in individuals of different ages including identical twin pairs. Contrary to the induction of VZV-specific antibodies, antigen-specific T cell responses were significantly influenced by inherited factors.

These data identify cell cycle regulatory mechanisms as targets to reduce T cell attrition in a vaccine response and to improve the generation of antigen-specific T cell memory, in particular in an older population.","Genes positively correlated with contraction of VZV specific T cells (peak to 28d) in peripheral blood mononuclear cell in seniors (50-75) after exposure to Zostavax , time point 1D","Qi Q,Cavanagh MM,Le Saux S,Wagar LE,Mackey S,Hu J,Maecker H,Swan GE,Davis MM,Dekker CL,Tian L,Weyand CM,Goronzy JJ",27764254,HUMAN_GENE_SYMBOL,"ABHD5,ACAP2,ADAR,ADD1,ADGRE2,ADGRE3,ADGRE5,ADPRS,AKIRIN2,ALDH2,ALOX5,AMY2A,ANTXR2,AP1M1,ARAP3,ARF1,ARHGAP25,ARHGAP30,ARHGDIB,ARID1A,ARPC5,ATP6V1B2,B4GALT5,BANP,BNIP3L,BTF3,BTN2A1,CAB39,CALM2,CAMK2G,CAP1,CAPNS1,CCR2,CD14,CD300A,CD300LF,CDC42,CFAP58,CHD1,CHST15,CITED2,CLEC16A,CLIC4,CLINT1,CLNS1A,CMIP,CPQ,CPSF1,CPVL,CREBBP,CTDSP2,CTNNA1,CYBA,CYBB,CYSLTR1,CYTIP,DCAF12,DCAF7,EXO5,DENND5A,DERL1,DIP2B,DNAJB6,DPYD,EFTUD2,EIF3L,EIF4A3,EIF4E3,ELF2,EMILIN2,ERGIC1,ERICH1,ESS2,FBXO33,FBXO7,FCGR3B,FGR,FNBP1,FNDC3B,FOS,FOXO3,FRAT1,GAB2,GAB3,GABARAPL2,GAS7,GATD3,GDI2,GIMAP8,GLB1,GNAI2,GRN,GTPBP4,HARS2,HCFC1,HDAC1,HERPUD1,HHEX,HLA-B,HLA-DRA,HLA-DRB3,HMGB2,HNRNPA2B1,HSPA1A,IFIH1,IGF2BP2,IK,CXCR2,IRF2BP2,IST1,ITGB1BP1,ITGB2,IWS1,JAK1,JARID2,KDM2B,KDM3B,KHDC4,KIF5B,L3MBTL2,LCP1,LILRA6,LIMS1,LMO2,GPC1-AS1,LPAR2,LRP10,LRRK2,MAN2B2,MARCKS,MED16,MLKL,MMP25,MORC2-AS1,MORF4L1,MTMR14,MTMR3,MYADM,MYH9,NAAA,NABP1,NACA,NARF,NCF1C,NCOA1,NCOA4,NCOA6,NFE2,NIBAN1,NKTR,NOMO1,NOTCH1,NPL,NUCB1,NUP93,PARP1,PCBP1,PCBP2,PCMTD1,PDE7A,PDLIM7,PGAM1,PGAM4,PGRMC2,PHIP,PLCG2,PLSCR1,POGK,POTEF,PPP1R21,PPP4R1,PPT1,PRKCB,PRKCD,PRR13,PSAP,PSMB10,PSME4,PTBP1,PTBP3,RAB11FIP1,RAB24,RAC2,RAF1,RALBP1,RB1CC1,RBL2,RBM33,RBM47,RERE,RESF1,RFTN1,RHOG,RIPOR1,RNASET2,RNF103,RNF114,RNF13,RNF130,RNF145,RNF149,RNF19A,RNF34,RNF40,ROCK2,RRBP1,RTF2,RUNDC1,RXRA,SARAF,SCAF11,SDE2,SDF4,SEC14L1,SELENOS,SELL,SERF1B,SERPINA1,SGK1,SH3GLB1,SH3KBP1,SHCBP1,SIGLEC10,SIGLEC14,SLA,SLC6A6,SLC7A5,SLCO3A1,SMAP2,SMNDC1,SNCA,SNRK,SOD2,SON,SP3,SPAG9,SPEN,SRSF5,ST13P4,ST6GAL1,STAT3,STX4,SYPL1,TACC1,TAGLN2,TALDO1,TCN1,TFDP1,TGFBR2,THUMPD1,TIPARP,TLR1,TLR4,TM2D3,TMBIM1,TMED7,TMEM140,TMEM158,TMEM179B,TMEM87A,TNFAIP6,TNFRSF1A,TNFRSF1B,TOMM20,TRIM58,TRIP12,TRMT5,TSC22D3,TTC27,TUBB,TXK,UBA7,UBAP1,UBC,UBE3C,UVSSA,VPS26B,VSIR,WAC,WAS,WBP2,WDR1,WDR37,WLS,YBX3,YIPF6,YWHAB,ZC3H4,ZC3H7A,ZC3HAV1,ZFAND5,ZHX2,ZMIZ1,ZNF217",294,"ABHD5,ACAP2,ADAR,ADD1,ADGRE2,ADGRE3,ADGRE5,ADPRHL2,AKIRIN2,ALDH2,ALOX5,AMY2A,ANTXR2,AP1M1,ARAP3,ARF1,ARHGAP25,ARHGAP30,ARHGDIB,ARID1A,ARPC5,ATP6V1B2,B4GALT5,BANP,BNIP3L,BTF3,BTN2A1,CAB39,CALM2,CAMK2G,CAP1,CAPNS1,CCR2,CD14,CD300A,CD300LF,CDC42,CFAP58,CHD1,CHST15,CITED2,CLEC16A,CLIC4,CLINT1,CLNS1A,CMIP,CPQ,CPSF1,CPVL,CREBBP,CTDSP2,CTNNA1,CYBA,CYBB,CYSLTR1,CYTIP,DCAF12,DCAF7,DEM1,DENND5A,DERL1,DIP2B,DNAJB6,DPYD,EFTUD2,EIF3L,EIF4A3,EIF4E3,ELF2,EMILIN2,ERGIC1,ERICH1,ESS2,FBXO33,FBXO7,FCGR3B,FGR,FNBP1,FNDC3B,FOS,FOXO3,FRAT1,GAB2,GAB3,GABARAPL2,GAS7,GATD3A,GDI2,GIMAP8,GLB1,GNAI2,GRN,GTPBP4,HARS2,HCFC1,HDAC1,HERPUD1,HHEX,HLA-B,HLA-DRA,HLA-DRB3,HMGB2,HNRPA2B1,HSPA1A,IFIH1,IGF2BP2,IK,IL8RB,IRF2BP2,IST1,ITGB1BP1,ITGB2,IWS1,JAK1,JARID2,KDM2B,KDM3B,KHDC4,KIF5B,L3MBTL2,LCP1,LILRA6,LIMS1,LMO2,LOC100130449,LPAR2,LRP10,LRRK2,MAN2B2,MARCKS,MED16,MLKL,MMP25,MORC2-AS1,MORF4L1,MTMR14,MTMR3,MYADM,MYH9,NAAA,NABP1,NACA,NARF,NCF1C,NCOA1,NCOA4,NCOA6,NFE2,NIBAN1,NKTR,NOMO1,NOTCH1,NPL,NUCB1,NUP93,PARP1,PCBP1,PCBP2,PCMTD1,PDE7A,PDLIM7,PGAM1,PGAM4,PGRMC2,PHIP,PLCG2,PLSCR1,POGK,POTEF,PPP1R21,PPP4R1,PPT1,PRKCB,PRKCD,PRR13,PSAP,PSMB10,PSME4,PTBP1,PTBP3,RAB11FIP1,RAB24,RAC2,RAF1,RALBP1,RB1CC1,RBL2,RBM33,RBM47,RERE,RESF1,RFTN1,RHOG,RIPOR1,RNASET2,RNF103,RNF114,RNF13,RNF130,RNF145,RNF149,RNF19A,RNF34,RNF40,ROCK2,RRBP1,RTF2,RUNDC1,RXRA,SARAF,SCAF11,SDE2,SDF4,SEC14L1,SELENOS,SELL,SERF1B,SERPINA1,SGK1,SH3GLB1,SH3KBP1,SHCBP1,SIGLEC10,SIGLEC14,SLA,SLC6A6,SLC7A5,SLCO3A1,SMAP2,SMNDC1,SNCA,SNRK,SOD2,SON,SP3,SPAG9,SPEN,SRSF5,ST13P4,ST6GAL1,STAT3,STX4,SYPL1,TACC1,TAGLN2,TALDO1,TCN1,TFDP1,TGFBR2,THUMPD1,TIPARP,TLR1,TLR4,TM2D3,TMBIM1,TMED7,TMEM140,TMEM158,TMEM179B,TMEM87A,TNFAIP6,TNFRSF1A,TNFRSF1B,TOMM20,TRIM58,TRIP12,TRMT5,TSC22D3,TTC27,TUBB,TXK,UBA7,UBAP1,UBC,UBE3C,UVSSA,VPS26B,VSIR,WAC,WAS,WBP2,WDR1,WDR37,WLS,YBX3,YIPF6,YWHAB,ZC3H4,ZC3H7A,ZC3HAV1,ZFAND5,ZHX2,ZMIZ1,ZNF217",C7:VAX,HIPC SIGNATURES,NIAID/HIPC SIGNATURES,Fig 3A,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3700883/figure/pone-0067922-g003/,NA,NA,NA,NA

To decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying variable vaccine responses, T- and B-cell responses to VZV vaccination were examined in individuals of different ages including identical twin pairs. Contrary to the induction of VZV-specific antibodies, antigen-specific T cell responses were significantly influenced by inherited factors. Diminished generation of long-lived memory T cells in older individuals was mainly caused by increased T cell loss after the peak response while the expansion of antigen-specific T cells was not affected by age.

However, the impact of vaccination on the cutaneous response to VZV is not known. Methods: We investigated the response to intradermal VZV antigen challenge before and after Zostavax vaccination in participants > 70 years of age by immunohistological and transcriptomic analyses of skin biopsy specimens collected from the challenge site. Results: Vaccination increased the proportion of VZV-specific CD4+ T cells in the blood and promoted the accumulation of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the skin after VZV antigen challenge. However, Zostavax did not alter the proportion of resident memory T cells (CD4+ and CD8+) or CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells in unchallenged skin.

In an effort to better understand the mechanisms of infection, including differences between people who produce a neutralizing antibody response to the vaccine and those who do not, we performed whole genome transcriptional analysis in human PBMCs exposed in vitro to the live-attenuated vaccine strain of VEEV, TC-83. We compared the molecular responses in cells from three groups of individuals: naive; previously vaccinated individuals who developed a neutralizing antibody response to the vaccine (responders); and those who did not develop a neutralizing antibody response to the vaccine (nonresponders). Overall, the changes in gene expression were more intense for the naive group after TC-83 challenge and least potent in the nonresponder group. The main canonical pathways revealed the involvement of interferon and interferon-induced pathways, as well as toll-like receptors TLR- and interleukin (IL)-12-related pathways. HLA class II genotype and suppression of transcript expression for TLR2, TLR4 and TLR8 in the nonresponder group may help explain the lack of vaccine response in this study group. Because TL3 and TLR7 transcripts were elevated in all study groups, these factors may be indicators of the infection and not the immunological state of the individuals. Biomarkers were identified that differentiate between the vaccine responder and the vaccine nonresponder groups.

However, the impact of vaccination on the cutaneous response to VZV is not known. Methods: We investigated the response to intradermal VZV antigen challenge before and after Zostavax vaccination in participants > 70 years of age by immunohistological and transcriptomic analyses of skin biopsy specimens collected from the challenge site. Results: Vaccination increased the proportion of VZV-specific CD4+ T cells in the blood and promoted the accumulation of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the skin after VZV antigen challenge. However, Zostavax did not alter the proportion of resident memory T cells (CD4+ and CD8+) or CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells in unchallenged skin. After vaccination, there was increased cutaneous T-cell proliferation at the challenge site and also increased recruitment of T cells from the blood, as indicated by an elevated T-cell migratory gene signature. CD8+ T-cell-associated functional genes were also highly induced in the skin after vaccination. Conclusion: Zostavax vaccination does not alter the abundance of cutaneous resident memory T cells but instead increases the recruitment of VZV-specific T cells from the blood and enhances T-cell activation, particularly cells of the CD8+ subset, in the skin after VZV antigen challenge.","Genes up-regulated in skin of body 6hr vs 0hr in adults (70-93) (VZV challenge) after exposure to Zostavax , time point 6H.

We performed mRNA-Seq profiling on PBMCs from high and low antibody responders to rubella vaccination to delineate transcriptional differences upon viral stimulation. Generalized linear models were used to assess the per gene fold change (FC) for stimulated versus unstimulated samples or the interaction between outcome and stimulation. Model results were evaluated by both FC and p-value. Pathway analysis and self-contained gene set tests were performed for assessment of gene group effects. Of 17,566 detected genes, we identified 1,080 highly significant differentially expressed genes upon viral stimulation (p < 1.00E(-15), FDR < 1.00E(-14)), including various immune function and inflammation-related genes, genes involved in cell signaling, cell regulation and transcription, and genes with unknown function. Analysis by immune outcome and stimulation status identified 27 genes (p <= 0.0006 and FDR <= 0.30) that responded differently to viral stimulation in high vs. low antibody responders, including major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes (HLA-A, HLA-B and B2M with p = 0.0001, p = 0.0005 and p = 0.0002, respectively), and two genes related to innate immunity and inflammation (EMR3 and MEFV with p = 1.46E(-08) and p = 0.0004, respectively). Pathway and gene set analysis also revealed transcriptional differences in antigen presentation and innate/inflammatory gene sets and pathways between high and low responders. Using mRNA-Seq genome-wide transcriptional profiling, we identified antigen presentation and innate/inflammatory genes that may assist in explaining rubella vaccine-induced immune response variations.

All three infections were characterized by the induction of many interferon stimulated genes, as well as enhanced expression of genes involved in proteolysis and antigen presentation. Vaccinia infection was also characterized by a distinct expression signature composed of up-regulation of monocyte response genes, with repression of genes expressed by B and T-cells. In contrast, the yellow fever host response was characterized by a suppression of ribosomal and translation factors, distinguishing this infection from vaccinia and URI. No significant URI-specific signature was observed, perhaps reflecting greater heterogeneity in the study population and etiological agents.

Whereas a vaccine is available for prevention of shingles, its efficacy declines with age. To help to understand the mechanisms driving vaccinal responses, we constructed a multiscale, multifactorial response network (MMRN) of immunity in healthy young and older adults immunized with the live attenuated shingles vaccine Zostavax. Vaccination induces robust antigen-specific antibody, plasmablasts, and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells yet limited CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell and antiviral responses. The MMRN reveals striking associations between orthogonal datasets, such as transcriptomic and metabolomics signatures, cell populations, and cytokine levels, and identifies immune and metabolic correlates of vaccine immunity. Networks associated with inositol phosphate, glycerophospholipids, and sterol metabolism are tightly coupled with immunity. Critically, the sterol regulatory binding protein 1 and its targets are key integrators of antibody and T follicular cell responses. Our approach is broadly applicable to study human immunity and can help to identify predictors of efficacy as well as mechanisms controlling immunity to vaccination.","Genes up-regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cell 1d vs 0d in adults (25-40/60-79) after exposure to Zostavax , time point 1D","Li S,Sullivan NL,Rouphael N,Yu T,Banton S,Maddur MS,McCausland M,Chiu C,Canniff J,Dubey S,Liu K,Tran V,Hagan T,Duraisingham S,Wieland A,Mehta AK,Whitaker JA,Subramaniam S,Jones DP,Sette A,Vora K,Weinberg A,Mulligan MJ,Nakaya HI,Levin M,Ahmed R,Pulendran B",28502771,HUMAN_GENE_SYMBOL,"CCL5,GZMH,MYO6,PSPH,S1PR5,SLC22A16,TARP",7,"CCL5,GZMH,MYO6,PSPH,S1PR5,SLC22A16,TARP",C7:VAX,HIPC SIGNATURES,NIAID/HIPC SIGNATURES,Suppl Fig 2A,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5711477/bin/NIHMS871779-supplement-2.tiff,NA,NA,NA,NA

We studied healthy adults vaccinated with trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) or live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). TIV induced higher antibody titers and more plasmablasts than LAIV did. In subjects vaccinated with TIV, early molecular signatures correlated with and could be used to accurately predict later antibody titers in two independent trials. Notably, expression of the kinase CaMKIV at day 3 was inversely correlated with later antibody titers. Vaccination of CaMKIV-deficient mice with TIV induced enhanced antigen-specific antibody titers, which demonstrated an unappreciated role for CaMKIV in the regulation of antibody responses. Thus, systems approaches can be used to predict immunogenicity and provide new mechanistic insights about vaccines.","Genes down-regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cell 3d vs 0d in adults (18-50) after exposure to FluMist , time point 3D.

We studied healthy adults vaccinated with trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) or live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). TIV induced higher antibody titers and more plasmablasts than LAIV did. In subjects vaccinated with TIV, early molecular signatures correlated with and could be used to accurately predict later antibody titers in two independent trials. Notably, expression of the kinase CaMKIV at day 3 was inversely correlated with later antibody titers. Vaccination of CaMKIV-deficient mice with TIV induced enhanced antigen-specific antibody titers, which demonstrated an unappreciated role for CaMKIV in the regulation of antibody responses. Thus, systems approaches can be used to predict immunogenicity and provide new mechanistic insights about vaccines.","Genes up-regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cell 3d vs 0d in adults (18-50) after exposure to FluMist , time point 3D.

Whereas a vaccine is available for prevention of shingles, its efficacy declines with age. To help to understand the mechanisms driving vaccinal responses, we constructed a multiscale, multifactorial response network (MMRN) of immunity in healthy young and older adults immunized with the live attenuated shingles vaccine Zostavax. Vaccination induces robust antigen-specific antibody, plasmablasts, and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells yet limited CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell and antiviral responses. The MMRN reveals striking associations between orthogonal datasets, such as transcriptomic and metabolomics signatures, cell populations, and cytokine levels, and identifies immune and metabolic correlates of vaccine immunity. Networks associated with inositol phosphate, glycerophospholipids, and sterol metabolism are tightly coupled with immunity. Critically, the sterol regulatory binding protein 1 and its targets are key integrators of antibody and T follicular cell responses. Our approach is broadly applicable to study human immunity and can help to identify predictors of efficacy as well as mechanisms controlling immunity to vaccination.","Genes up-regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cell 3d vs 0d in adults (25-40/60-79) after exposure to Zostavax , time point 3D","Li S,Sullivan NL,Rouphael N,Yu T,Banton S,Maddur MS,McCausland M,Chiu C,Canniff J,Dubey S,Liu K,Tran V,Hagan T,Duraisingham S,Wieland A,Mehta AK,Whitaker JA,Subramaniam S,Jones DP,Sette A,Vora K,Weinberg A,Mulligan MJ,Nakaya HI,Levin M,Ahmed R,Pulendran B",28502771,HUMAN_GENE_SYMBOL,"EGR1,ERAP2,IFI44L,KDELR2,MX1,PDP1,PSPH",7,"EGR1,ERAP2,IFI44L,KDELR2,MX1,PDP1,PSPH",C7:VAX,HIPC SIGNATURES,NIAID/HIPC SIGNATURES,Suppl Fig 2A,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5711477/bin/NIHMS871779-supplement-2.tiff,NA,NA,NA,NA

All three infections were characterized by the induction of many interferon stimulated genes, as well as enhanced expression of genes involved in proteolysis and antigen presentation. Vaccinia infection was also characterized by a distinct expression signature composed of up-regulation of monocyte response genes, with repression of genes expressed by B and T-cells.

In contrast, the yellow fever host response was characterized by a suppression of ribosomal and translation factors, distinguishing this infection from vaccinia and URI. No significant URI-specific signature was observed, perhaps reflecting greater heterogeneity in the study population and etiological agents. Taken together, these data suggest that specific host gene expression signatures may be identified that distinguish one or a small number of virus agents.","Genes up-regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (50 to 60)d vs 0d in adults (18-32) after exposure to APSV Wetvax , time point 50 to 60D","Scherer CA,Magness CL,Steiger KV,Poitinger ND,Caputo CM,Miner DG,Winokur PL,Klinzman D,McKee J,Pilar C,Ward PA,Gillham MH,Haulman NJ,Stapleton JT,Iadonato SP",17651872,HUMAN_GENE_SYMBOL,"ACAD9,ACBD5,ADM,AFAP1,AGFG1,CRYBG1,ANKLE2,,AREG,ARID5A,ATG2A,ATM,ATP1B3,B4GALT4,BCL2A1,BTG3,CASP3,CBLB,CCNE1,CCNL1,CD47,CD55,CDC73,CDKN1B,CDKN2C,CFI,CHD1,CLEC2B,CLK1,CLSTN3,COL4A5,CREM,CRH,CRTAM,CSNK1A1,CXCR4,DCAF11,DCTN6,DLL1,DNTTIP2,DUSP12,DYRK1A,EIF1B,ELAC1,ERH,ETF1,ETS2,FN1,FNBP4,G0S2,GADD45A,GALNT3,GNG10,HBP1,LAMTOR5,HCK,HERC1,HERPUD1,HIF1A,HMCES,HNRNPA3P1,HPGD,ID2,IDS,IFNGR1,IL13,IL18,CXCL8,CXCR2,INSIG1,IRS2,JARID2,KDM6A,NDC80,LITAF,LMO4,LPIN1,LUC7L3,MAP4K5,MCL1,,MPP7,MXD1,MXI1,NDUFV2,NIBAN1,NKRF,NR4A2,OSGIN2,P2RY10,NAMPT,PDE4B,PDK4,PER1,PFKFB3,PHF12,PIK3R1,PIP5K1A,PLAT,PNN,POLR3E,PPM1A,PPM1B,SRGN,PRKCH,PRKDC,PRMT3,PRPS1,PSMC5,PTBP2,PTP4A1,PTPN22,RABGGTB,RASA2,RBBP6,TRIM13,RGPD5,RIPK2,RNF103,RSRC2,RTF1,RUNX1,S100P,SAR1A,SBDS,SC5D,SEC63,SERINC1,SESN1,SETD2,MTREX,SLC16A6,SLC7A5,SMAD3,SMNDC1,SNIP1,SNRPE,SOD2,HSPA13,STIM1,STRAP,TAF13,TAS2R5,TGFBR3,THBD,TLE1,TMED10,TNC,TNFAIP3,TNKS2,TOB1,TRIM23,TTC32,UBE2D3,UQCRFS1,USP14,USP48,UVRAG,WDR26,YES1,ZBTB1,ZFP36L2,ZFP91,ZKSCAN1,ZNF267,ZNF281,ZNF326,ZNF394,ZNF451,ADNP2,ZNF625",171,"ACAD9,ACBD5,ADM,AFAP,AGFG1,AIM1,ANKLE2,APG1,AREG,ARID5A,ATG2A,ATM,ATP1B3,B4GALT4,BCL2A1,BTG3,CASP3,CBLB,CCNE1,CCNL1,CD47,CD55,CDC73,CDKN1B,CDKN2C,CFI,CHD1,CLEC2B,CLK1,CLSTN3,COL4A5,CREM,CRH,CRTAM,CSNK1A1,CXCR4,DCAF11,DCTN6,DLL1,DNTTIP2,DUSP12,DYRK1A,EIF1B,ELAC1,ERH,ETF1,ETS2,FN1,FNBP4,G0S2,GADD45A,GALNT3,GNG10,HBP1,HBXIP,HCK,HERC1,HERPUD1,HIF1A,HMCES,HNRPA3,HPGD,ID2,IDS,IFNGR1,IL13,IL18,IL8,IL8RB,INSIG1,IRS2,JARID2,KDM6A,KNTC2,LITAF,LMO4,LPIN1,LUC7L3,MAP4K5,MCL1,MIR570HG,MPP7,MXD1,MXI1,NDUFV2,NIBAN1,NKRF,NR4A2,OSGIN2,P2RY10,PBEF1,PDE4B,PDK4,PER1,PFKFB3,PHF12,PIK3R1,PIP5K1A,PLAT,PNN,POLR3E,PPM1A,PPM1B,PRG1,PRKCH,PRKDC,PRMT3,PRPS1,PSMC5,PTBP2,PTP4A1,PTPN22,RABGGTB,RASA2,RBBP6,RFP2,RGPD5,RIPK2,RNF103,RSRC2,RTF1,RUNX1,S100P,SAR1A,SBDS,SC5DL,SEC63,SERINC1,SESN1,SETD2,SKIV2L2,SLC16A6,SLC7A5,SMAD3,SMNDC1,SNIP1,SNRPE,SOD2,STCH,STIM1,STRAP,TAF13,TAS2R5,TGFBR3,THBD,TLE1,TMED10,TNC,TNFAIP3,TNKS2,TOB1,TRIM23,TTC32,UBE2D3,UQCRFS1,USP14,USP48,UVRAG,WDR26,YES1,ZBTB1,ZFP36L2,ZFP91,ZKSCAN1,ZNF267,ZNF281,ZNF326,ZNF394,ZNF451,ZNF508,ZNF625",C7:VAX,HIPC SIGNATURES,NIAID/HIPC SIGNATURES,Table 4,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2211276/table/T4/,NA,NA,NA,NA

We studied healthy adults vaccinated with trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) or live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). TIV induced higher antibody titers and more plasmablasts than LAIV did. In subjects vaccinated with TIV, early molecular signatures correlated with and could be used to accurately predict later antibody titers in two independent trials. Notably, expression of the kinase CaMKIV at day 3 was inversely correlated with later antibody titers. Vaccination of CaMKIV-deficient mice with TIV induced enhanced antigen-specific antibody titers, which demonstrated an unappreciated role for CaMKIV in the regulation of antibody responses. Thus, systems approaches can be used to predict immunogenicity and provide new mechanistic insights about vaccines.","Genes down-regulated in B cell 7d vs 0d in young adults (18-50) after exposure to

We studied healthy adults vaccinated with trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) or live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). TIV induced higher antibody titers and more plasmablasts than LAIV did. In subjects vaccinated with TIV, early molecular signatures correlated with and could be used to accurately predict later antibody titers in two independent trials. Notably, expression of the kinase CaMKIV at day 3 was inversely correlated with later antibody titers. Vaccination of CaMKIV-deficient mice with TIV induced enhanced antigen-specific antibody titers, which demonstrated an unappreciated role for CaMKIV in the regulation of antibody responses. Thus, systems approaches can be used to predict immunogenicity and provide new mechanistic insights about vaccines.","Genes up-regulated in B cell 7d vs 0d in young adults (18-50) after exposure to

We studied healthy adults vaccinated with trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) or live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). TIV induced higher antibody titers and more plasmablasts than LAIV did. In subjects vaccinated with TIV, early molecular signatures correlated with and could be used to accurately predict later antibody titers in two independent trials. Notably, expression of the kinase CaMKIV at day 3 was inversely correlated with later antibody titers. Vaccination of CaMKIV-deficient mice with TIV induced enhanced antigen-specific antibody titers, which demonstrated an unappreciated role for CaMKIV in the regulation of antibody responses. Thus, systems approaches can be used to predict immunogenicity and provide new mechanistic insights about vaccines.","Genes down-regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cell 7d vs 0d in adults (18-50) after exposure to FluMist , time point 7D.

We studied healthy adults vaccinated with trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) or live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). TIV induced higher antibody titers and more plasmablasts than LAIV did. In subjects vaccinated with TIV, early molecular signatures correlated with and could be used to accurately predict later antibody titers in two independent trials. Notably, expression of the kinase CaMKIV at day 3 was inversely correlated with later antibody titers. Vaccination of CaMKIV-deficient mice with TIV induced enhanced antigen-specific antibody titers, which demonstrated an unappreciated role for CaMKIV in the regulation of antibody responses. Thus, systems approaches can be used to predict immunogenicity and provide new mechanistic insights about vaccines.","Genes up-regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cell 7d vs 0d in adults (18-50) after exposure to FluMist , time point 7D.

We studied healthy adults vaccinated with trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) or live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). TIV induced higher antibody titers and more plasmablasts than LAIV did. In subjects vaccinated with TIV, early molecular signatures correlated with and could be used to accurately predict later antibody titers in two independent trials. Notably, expression of the kinase CaMKIV at day 3 was inversely correlated with later antibody titers. Vaccination of CaMKIV-deficient mice with TIV induced enhanced antigen-specific antibody titers, which demonstrated an unappreciated role for CaMKIV in the regulation of antibody responses. Thus, systems approaches can be used to predict immunogenicity and provide new mechanistic insights about vaccines.","Genes up-regulated in plasmacytoid dendritic cell 7d vs 0d in young adults (18-50)

We have studied the safety and immunogenicity of oral (PO) and/or intradermal (ID) administration of BCG in healthy human subjects. No major safety concerns were detected in the 68 healthy adults vaccinated with PO and/or ID BCG. Although both PO and ID BCG could induce systemic Th1 responses capable of IFN-gamma production, ID BCG more strongly induced systemic Th1 responses. In contrast, stronger mucosal responses (TB-specific secretory IgA and bronchoalveolar lavage T cells) were induced by PO BCG vaccination. To generate preliminary data comparing the early gene signatures induced by mucosal and systemic BCG vaccination, CD4<sup>+</sup> memory T cells were isolated from subsets of BCG vaccinated subjects pre- (Day 0) and post-vaccination (Days 7 and 56), rested or stimulated with BCG infected dendritic cells, and then studied by Illumina BeadArray transcriptomal analysis. Notably, distinct gene expression profiles were identified both on Day 7 and Day 56 comparing the PO and ID BCG vaccinated groups by GSEA analysis. Future correlation analyses between specific gene expression patterns and distinct mucosal and systemic immune responses induced will be highly informative for TB vaccine development.","Genes down-regulated in CD4-positive, alpha-beta memory T cell 7d vs 0d in adults (18-45) after exposure to BCG vaccine , time point 7D , administered PO (oral).

To generate preliminary data comparing the early gene signatures induced by mucosal and systemic BCG vaccination, CD4<sup>+</sup> memory T cells were isolated from subsets of BCG vaccinated subjects pre- (Day 0) and post-vaccination (Days 7 and 56), rested or stimulated with BCG infected dendritic cells, and then studied by Illumina BeadArray transcriptomal analysis. Notably, distinct gene expression profiles were identified both on Day 7 and Day 56 comparing the PO and ID BCG vaccinated groups by GSEA analysis. Future correlation analyses between specific gene expression patterns and distinct mucosal and systemic immune responses induced will be highly informative for TB vaccine development.","Genes up-regulated in CD4-positive, alpha-beta memory T cell 7d vs 0d in adults (18-45) after exposure to BCG vaccine , time point 7D , administered PO (oral).

To decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying variable vaccine responses, T- and B-cell responses to VZV vaccination were examined in individuals of different ages including identical twin pairs. Contrary to the induction of VZV-specific antibodies, antigen-specific T cell responses were significantly influenced by inherited factors. Diminished generation of long-lived memory T cells in older individuals was mainly caused by increased T cell loss after the peak response while the expansion of antigen-specific T cells was not affected by age. Gene expression in activated CD4 T cells at the time of the peak response identified gene modules related to cell cycle regulation and DNA repair that correlated with the contraction phase of the T cell response and consequently the generation of long-lived memory cells. These data identify cell cycle regulatory mechanisms as targets to reduce T cell attrition in a vaccine response and to improve the generation of antigen-specific T cell memory, in particular in an older population.","Genes up-regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cell 1d vs 0d in seniors (50-75) after exposure to Zostavax , time point 1D.

To better understand this difference, this study compared the mRNA sequencing transcription profile (RNA seq) in children who received either IIV or LAIV. METHODS: Children 3-17years of age receiving quadrivalent influenza vaccine were enrolled. Blood samples were collected on Day 0 prior to vaccination and again on Day 7 (range 6-10days) following vaccination. Total RNA was isolated from PAXgene tubes and sequenced for a custom panel of 89 transcripts using the TruSeq Targeted RNA Expression method. Fold differences in normalized RNA seq counts from Day 0 to Day 7 were calculated, log<sub>2</sub> transformed and compared between the two vaccine groups. RESULTS: Of 72 children, 46 received IIV and 26 received LAIV. Following IIV vaccination, 7 genes demonstrated significant differential expression at Day 7 (down-regulated). In contrast, following LAIV vaccination, 8 genes demonstrated significant differential expression at Day 7 (5 up-regulated and 3 down-regulated). Only two genes demonstrated similar patterns of regulation in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Differential regulation of genes was observed between 2015-16 LAIV and IIV recipients.

This impedes the development of novel vaccines to incurable diseases such as HIV and cancer. In this study, we have used functional genomics and polychromatic flow cytometry to define the signature of the immune response to the yellow fever (YF) vaccine 17D (YF17D) in a cohort of 40 volunteers followed for up to 1 yr after vaccination. We show that immunization with YF17D leads to an integrated immune response that includes several effector arms of innate immunity, including complement, the inflammasome, and interferons, as well as adaptive immunity as shown by an early T cell response followed by a brisk and variable B cell response. Development of these responses is preceded, as demonstrated in three independent vaccination trials and in a novel in vitro system of primary immune responses (modular immune in vitro construct [MIMIC] system), by the coordinated up-regulation of transcripts for specific transcription factors, including STAT1, IRF7, and ETS2, which are upstream of the different effector arms of the immune response. These results clearly show that the immune response to a strong vaccine is preceded by coordinated induction of master transcription factors that lead to the development of a broad, polyfunctional, and persistent immune response that integrates all effector cells of the immune system.","Genes down-regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cell 10d vs 0d in unknown after exposure to YF-Vax/Stamaril , time point 10D","Gaucher D,Therrien R,Kettaf N,Angermann BR,Boucher G,Filali-Mouhim A,Moser JM,Mehta RS,Drake DR 3rd,Castro E,Akondy R,Rinfret A,Yassine-Diab B,Said EA,Chouikh Y,Cameron MJ,Clum R,Kelvin D,Somogyi R,Greller LD,Balderas RS,Wilkinson P,Pantaleo G,Tartaglia J,Haddad EK,Sékaly RP",19047440,HUMAN_GENE_SYMBOL,"ABCC5,ABHD5,ABTB1,ADGRE3,ALKBH7,ALPL,APMAP,ARAP3,ARHGAP24,BTF3,GUCD1,FAXDC2,CA4,CAMK1D,CD46,CDK19,CPPED1,CYP27A1,DCAF12,DCAF6,DDX3X,EEF2,EIF3F,EIF3L,EIF4B,ELAPOR1,EPB42,ERGIC1,NIBAN1,FAM210B,FBXO7,FCER1A,FOXO1,GLS,GNG7,GPR162,H1-2,HECA,HSD17B11,ICAM3,IL1R2,IMPA2,IRS2,KBTBD7,LGALS3,LINC00265,,LMBRD1,LST1,MED25,MEF2D,MKRN1,MPP1,MPZL1,MYADM,NPL,ORM1,OSBP2,PABPC1,PABPC4,PACS1,PANX2,PCBP2,PDZK1IP1,PHOSPHO1,PI3,PINK1,PIP4K2A,PITHD1,PLVAP,PPM1F,PRDX2,PRKDC,PTOV1,PYGL,RFLNB,RPL22,RPL37A,RPS3,RPS4X,RPS6KA5,RUBCNL,SELENBP1,SERF2,SIGLEC10,SNCA,SNRPG,SORL1,SRRD,STAT5B,STMN3,TAGLN2,TBC1D14,TBL1X,TGM3,TMCO3,TNS1,TOPORS,TP53INP2,TSPAN5,TXNDC12,TMX4,UBE2H,USP10,VNN2,WLS,ZNF217",107,"ABCC5,ABHD5,ABTB1,ADGRE3,ALKBH7,ALPL,APMAP,ARAP3,ARHGAP24,BTF3,C22orf13,C5orf4,CA4,CAMK1D,CD46,CDK19,CPPED1,CYP27A1,DCAF12,DCAF6,DDX3X,EEF2,EIF3F,EIF3L,EIF4B,ELAPOR1,EPB42,ERGIC1,FAM129A,FAM210B,FBXO7,FCER1A,FOXO1,GLS,GNG7,GPR162,H1-2,HECA,HSD17B11,ICAM3,IL1R2,IMPA2,IRS2,KBTBD7,LGALS3,LINC00265,LINC00999,LMBRD1,LST1,MED25,MEF2D,MKRN1,MPP1,MPZL1,MYADM,NPL,ORM1,OSBP2,PABPC1,PABPC4,PACS1,PANX2,PCBP2,PDZK1IP1,PHOSPHO1,PI3,PINK1,PIP4K2A,PITHD1,PLVAP,PPM1F,PRDX2,PRKDC,PTOV1,PYGL,RFLNB,RPL22,RPL37A,RPS3,RPS4X,RPS6KA5,RUBCNL,SELENBP1,SERF2,SIGLEC10,SNCA,SNRPG,SORL1,SRRD,STAT5B,STMN3,TAGLN2,TBC1D14,TBL1X,TGM3,TMCO3,TNS1,TOPORS,TP53INP2,TSPAN5,TXNDC12,TXNDC13,UBE2H,USP10,VNN2,WLS,ZNF217",C7:VAX,HIPC SIGNATURES,NIAID/HIPC SIGNATURES,Fig 6C (PO),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5832504/figure/F6/,NA,NA,NA,NA

These results clearly show that the immune response to a strong vaccine is preceded by coordinated induction of master transcription factors that lead to the development of a broad, polyfunctional, and persistent immune response that integrates all effector cells of the immune system.","Genes down-regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cell 3d vs 0d in unknown after exposure to YF-Vax/Stamaril , time point 3D","Gaucher D,Therrien R,Kettaf N,Angermann BR,Boucher G,Filali-Mouhim A,Moser JM,Mehta RS,Drake DR 3rd,Castro E,Akondy R,Rinfret A,Yassine-Diab B,Said EA,Chouikh Y,Cameron MJ,Clum R,Kelvin D,Somogyi R,Greller LD,Balderas RS,Wilkinson P,Pantaleo G,Tartaglia J,Haddad EK,Sékaly RP",19047440,HUMAN_GENE_SYMBOL,"ABCC5,ABHD5,ADGRE3,ALKBH7,ALPL,ARAP3,BANK1,BCL6,C12orf57,CAMK1D,CBX7,CD46,CDK19,CPD,CPPED1,CREB5,DDX3X,EEF1A1,EEF1B2,EEF2,EIF3F,EIF3L,EIF4B,ELAPOR1,ERGIC1,HYCC2,ATOSA,FAU,FBL,FCRLA,FOXO1,GLS,GMCL1,GNG7,GPR162,GPR183,H1-2,H4C3,ICAM3,IMPA2,IRS2,KBTBD7,KLHDC2,KLHL2,LMBRD1,MPZL1,MYADM,NAMPT,NARF,NFXL1,NIBAN1,ORM1,OSBPL8,PABPC4,PI3,PPM1F,PRKDC,PTOV1,PYGL,RBM47,RFLNB,RPL13A,RPL18,RPL22,RPL27,RPL3,RPL30,RPL35A,RPL37A,RPL4,RPL5,RPLP0,RPS13,RPS14,RPS18,RPS20,RPS25,RPS27A,RPS29,RPS3,RPS4X,RPS5,RPS6,RPS6KA5,RPS8,RUBCNL,SEL1L3,SNHG29,SORL1,STAT5B,STMN3,TBC1D14,TBL1X,TMCO3,TOMM7,TOPORS,TP53INP2,TPT1,TXNDC12,TMX4,VNN2,WLS,ZNF217,ZNF281",104,"ABCC5,ABHD5,ADGRE3,ALKBH7,ALPL,ARAP3,BANK1,BCL6,C12orf57,CAMK1D,CBX7,CD46,CDK19,CPD,CPPED1,CREB5,DDX3X,EEF1A1,EEF1B2,EEF2,EIF3F,EIF3L,EIF4B,ELAPOR1,ERGIC1,FAM126B,FAM214A,FAU,FBL,FCRLA,FOXO1,GLS,GMCL1,GNG7,GPR162,GPR183,H1-2,H4C3,ICAM3,IMPA2,IRS2,KBTBD7,KLHDC2,KLHL2,LMBRD1,MPZL1,MYADM,NAMPT,NARF,NFXL1,NIBAN1,ORM1,OSBPL8,PABPC4,PI3,PPM1F,PRKDC,PTOV1,PYGL,RBM47,RFLNB,RPL13A,RPL18,RPL22,RPL27,RPL3,RPL30,RPL35A,RPL37A,RPL4,RPL5,RPLP0,RPS13,RPS14,RPS18,RPS20,RPS25,RPS27A,RPS29,RPS3,RPS4X,RPS5,RPS6,RPS6KA5,RPS8,RUBCNL,SEL1L3,SNHG29,SORL1,STAT5B,STMN3,TBC1D14,TBL1X,TMCO3,TOMM7,TOPORS,TP53INP2,TPT1,TXNDC12,TXNDC13,VNN2,WLS,ZNF217,ZNF281",C7:VAX,HIPC SIGNATURES,NIAID/HIPC SIGNATURES,Suppl Table 1,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4356402/#SD1,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this study, we have used functional genomics and polychromatic flow cytometry to define the signature of the immune response to the yellow fever (YF) vaccine 17D (YF17D) in a cohort of 40 volunteers followed for up to 1 yr after vaccination. We show that immunization with YF17D leads to an integrated immune response that includes several effector arms of innate immunity, including complement, the inflammasome, and interferons, as well as adaptive immunity as shown by an early T cell response followed by a brisk and variable B cell response. Development of these responses is preceded, as demonstrated in three independent vaccination trials and in a novel in vitro system of primary immune responses (modular immune in vitro construct [MIMIC] system), by the coordinated up-regulation of transcripts for specific transcription factors, including STAT1, IRF7, and ETS2, which are upstream of the different effector arms of the immune response. These results clearly show that the immune response to a strong vaccine is preceded by coordinated induction of master transcription factors that lead to the development of a broad, polyfunctional, and persistent immune response that integrates all effector cells of the immune system.","Genes up-regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cell 7d vs 0d in unknown after exposure to YF-Vax/Stamaril , time point 7D","Gaucher D,Therrien R,Kettaf N,Angermann BR,Boucher G,Filali-Mouhim A,Moser JM,Mehta RS,Drake DR 3rd,Castro E,Akondy R,Rinfret A,Yassine-Diab B,Said EA,Chouikh Y,Cameron MJ,Clum R,Kelvin D,Somogyi R,Greller LD,Balderas RS,Wilkinson P,Pantaleo G,Tartaglia J,Haddad EK,Sékaly RP",19047440,HUMAN_GENE_SYMBOL,"ABCA1,ABI3,ACOT7,ACOT9,ACTA2,ADA,ADA2,ADAP2,ADAR,AIM2,ALDH3B1,ANKFY1,ANKRD22,AP5B1,APOBEC3A,APOBEC3F,APOL3,ASCL2,ASPRV1,ATF3,ATF5,CSRNP1,BATF2,BLVRA,BST2,BTN3A1,C1QA,C1QB,C3AR1,CAMK1,CAP1,CASP5,CCL8,CCNB2,CCR1,CD163,CD300C,CD36,CD38,CD68,CD74,CD86,CDC20,CDCA5,CDCA7,CDKN1A,CDKN1C,CEACAM1,CENPM,CHMP5,CMPK2,CNDP2,CSF1R,CST3,CTSL,CUL1,CX3CR1,CXCL10,CYBB,CYSLTR1,RIGI,DDX60,DHRS9,DHX58,DPYSL2,DRAP1,DUSP5,DYNLT1,EIF2AK2,EMILIN2,EPB41L3,EPSTI1,FAM8A1,FBXO6,FCER1G,FCN1,FFAR2,FLVCR2,FRMD3,GADD45B,GALM,GBP1,GBP2,GBP4,GBP5,GCH1,GIMAP8,GLMP,GNA15,GNGT2,GNLY,GORASP1,GPBAR1,GRN,GZMB,HAVCR2,HELZ2,HERC5,HERC6,HES4,HK3,HLA-A,HLA-DRB4,HMOX1,HSH2D,IDH2,IDO1,IFI16,IFI27,IFI30,IFI35,IFI44,IFI44L,IFI6,IFIH1,IFIT1,IFIT2,IFIT3,IFIT5,IFITM1,IFITM3,IL15,IL1RN,IRF7,IRF9,ISG15,ISG20,JUP,KCNMB1,KIAA0319L,KIR2DL3,KIR2DL4,KYNU,LAG3,LAMP3,LAP3,LDLR,LGALS3BP,LGALS9,LHFPL2,LILRB1,LMO2,LY6E,MAD2L1BP,MAFB,MARCKS,MARCO,MCM4,MICB,MOB3C,MOV10,MS4A7,MT1A,MT1F,MT2A,MX1,MX2,MYD88,MYDGF,MYOF,NAGA,NAGK,NAPA,NCOA7,NEXN,NLRP3,NMI,NOD2,NPC2,NRROS,NT5C,NTNG2,NUB1,NUSAP1,OAS1,OAS2,OAS3,OASL,OGFR,OSBPL5,OTOF,PARP10,PARP12,PARP14,PARP9,PATL1,PCK2,PHACTR2,PHF11,PIK3AP1,PLAC8,PLAGL2,PLSCR1,PML,PPM1K,PRAM1,PRF1,PSME1,PSME2,PTGDS,RAB8A,RBCK1,REC8,RGL1,RGS12,RHBDF2,RIN2,RIPK3,RNF135,RNF31,RNH1,RRAS,RSAD2,RTCB,RTP4,SAMD4A,SAMD9L,SAT1,SCARB2,SCIMP,SCO2,SDF2L1,SEPTIN4,SERPING1,SERTAD1,SHFL,SHISA5,SIDT2,SIGLEC5,SIL1,SLC27A3,SLC2A6,SLC37A2,SLC3A2,SLFN12,SMCO4,SNTB1,SOCS1,SORT1,SP110,SP140,SPATS2L,SQOR,SRBD1,SRC,SRM,STAB1,STAT1,STAT2,SUSD1,TAGLN,TAP1,TAP2,TCN2,TDRD7,TENT5A,TICAM1,TIMM10,TLR7,TMEM123,TMEM140,TMEM268,TMEM51,TMEM62,TNFAIP6,TNFSF10,TNFSF13B,TNS3,TOR1B,TRAFD1,TRIM21,TRIM22,TRIM26,TRIM38,TRIM5,TTC21A,TTC38,TTYH3,TUBG1,TXNDC11,TYMP,UBA7,UBE2L6,UBE2S,UNC93B1,VAMP5,WARS1,XAF1,ZBP1,ZC3HAV1,ZFYVE26,ZNFX1",292,"ABCA1,ABI3,ACOT7,ACOT9,ACTA2,ADA,ADA2,ADAP2,ADAR,AIM2,ALDH3B1,ANKFY1,ANKRD22,AP5B1,APOBEC3A,APOBEC3F,APOL3,ASCL2,ASPRV1,ATF3,ATF5,AXUD1,BATF2,BLVRA,BST2,BTN3A1,C1QA,C1QB,C3AR1,CAMK1,CAP1,CASP5,CCL8,CCNB2,CCR1,CD163,CD300C,CD36,CD38,CD68,CD74,CD86,CDC20,CDCA5,CDCA7,CDKN1A,CDKN1C,CEACAM1,CENPM,CHMP5,CMPK2,CNDP2,CSF1R,CST3,CTSL,CUL1,CX3CR1,CXCL10,CYBB,CYSLTR1,DDX58,DDX60,DHRS9,DHX58,DPYSL2,DRAP1,DUSP5,DYNLT1,EIF2AK2,EMILIN2,EPB41L3,EPSTI1,FAM8A1,FBXO6,FCER1G,FCN1,FFAR2,FLVCR2,FRMD3,GADD45B,GALM,GBP1,GBP2,GBP4,GBP5,GCH1,GIMAP8,GLMP,GNA15,GNGT2,GNLY,GORASP1,GPBAR1,GRN,GZMB,HAVCR2,HELZ2,HERC5,HERC6,HES4,HK3,HLA-A,HLA-DRB4,HMOX1,HSH2D,IDH2,IDO1,IFI16,IFI27,IFI30,IFI35,IFI44,IFI44L,IFI6,IFIH1,IFIT1,IFIT2,IFIT3,IFIT5,IFITM1,IFITM3,IL15,IL1RN,IRF7,IRF9,ISG15,ISG20,JUP,KCNMB1,KIAA0319L,KIR2DL3,KIR2DL4,KYNU,LAG3,LAMP3,LAP3,LDLR,LGALS3BP,LGALS9,LHFPL2,LILRB1,LMO2,LY6E,MAD2L1BP,MAFB,MARCKS,MARCO,MCM4,MICB,MOB3C,MOV10,MS4A7,MT1A,MT1F,MT2A,MX1,MX2,MYD88,MYDGF,MYOF,NAGA,NAGK,NAPA,NCOA7,NEXN,NLRP3,NMI,NOD2,NPC2,NRROS,NT5C,NTNG2,NUB1,NUSAP1,OAS1,OAS2,OAS3,OASL,OGFR,OSBPL5,OTOF,PARP10,PARP12,PARP14,PARP9,PATL1,PCK2,PHACTR2,PHF11,PIK3AP1,PLAC8,PLAGL2,PLSCR1,PML,PPM1K,PRAM1,PRF1,PSME1,PSME2,PTGDS,RAB8A,RBCK1,REC8,RGL1,RGS12,RHBDF2,RIN2,RIPK3,RNF135,RNF31,RNH1,RRAS,RSAD2,RTCB,RTP4,SAMD4A,SAMD9L,SAT1,SCARB2,SCIMP,SCO2,SDF2L1,SEPTIN4,SERPING1,SERTAD1,SHFL,SHISA5,SIDT2,SIGLEC5,SIL1,SLC27A3,SLC2A6,SLC37A2,SLC3A2,SLFN12,SMCO4,SNTB1,SOCS1,SORT1,SP110,SP140,SPATS2L,SQOR,SRBD1,SRC,SRM,STAB1,STAT1,STAT2,SUSD1,TAGLN,TAP1,TAP2,TCN2,TDRD7,TENT5A,TICAM1,TIMM10,TLR7,TMEM123,TMEM140,TMEM268,TMEM51,TMEM62,TNFAIP6,TNFSF10,TNFSF13B,TNS3,TOR1B,TRAFD1,TRIM21,TRIM22,TRIM26,TRIM38,TRIM5,TTC21A,TTC38,TTYH3,TUBG1,TXNDC11,TYMP,UBA7,UBE2L6,UBE2S,UNC93B1,VAMP5,WARS,XAF1,ZBP1,ZC3HAV1,ZFYVE26,ZNFX1",C7:VAX,HIPC SIGNATURES,NIAID/HIPC SIGNATURES,Table 1,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3723701/table/T1/,NA,NA,NA,NA

The virus is endemic in Central and South America, but has also caused equine outbreaks in southwestern areas of the United States. In an effort to better understand the molecular mechanisms of the development of immunity to this important pathogen, we performed transcriptional analysis from whole, unfractionated human blood of patients who had been immunized with the live-attenuated vaccine strain of VEEV, TC-83. We compared changes in the transcriptome between naive individuals who were mock vaccinated with saline to responses of individuals who received TC-83. Significant transcriptional changes were noted at days 2, 7, and 14 following vaccination. The top canonical pathways revealed at early and intermediate time points (days 2 and 7) included the involvement of the classic interferon response, interferon-response factors, activation of pattern recognition receptors, and engagement of the inflammasome. By day 14, the top canonical pathways included oxidative phosphorylation, the protein ubiquitination pathway, natural killer cell signaling, and B-cell development. Biomarkers were identified that differentiate between vaccinees and control subjects, at early, intermediate, and late stages of the development of immunity as well as markers which were common to all 3 stages following vaccination but distinct from the sham-vaccinated control subjects. The study represents a novel examination of molecular processes that lead to the development of immunity against VEEV in humans and which may be of value as diagnostic targets, to enhance modern vaccine design, or molecular correlates of protection.","Genes down-regulated in blood vaccinated vs control in adults (23-48) after exposure to Live attenuated vaccine TC-83 , time point 14D","Erwin-Cohen RA,Porter AI,Pittman PR,Rossi CA,DaSilva L",27870591,HUMAN_GENE_SYMBOL,"EPB42,LINC01002,OR2W3,PI3,SELENBP1,SLC4A1,TNS1",7,"EPB42,LINC01002,OR2W3,PI3,SELENBP1,SLC4A1,TNS1",C7:VAX,HIPC SIGNATURES,NIAID/HIPC SIGNATURES,Suppl Table 1,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4946173/bin/mmc1.docx,NA,NA,NA,NA

The virus is endemic in Central and South America, but has also caused equine outbreaks in southwestern areas of the United States. In an effort to better understand the molecular mechanisms of the development of immunity to this important pathogen, we performed transcriptional analysis from whole, unfractionated human blood of patients who had been immunized with the live-attenuated vaccine strain of VEEV, TC-83. We compared changes in the transcriptome between naive individuals who were mock vaccinated with saline to responses of individuals who received TC-83. Significant transcriptional changes were noted at days 2, 7, and 14 following vaccination. The top canonical pathways revealed at early and intermediate time points (days 2 and 7) included the involvement of the classic interferon response, interferon-response factors, activation of pattern recognition receptors, and engagement of the inflammasome. By day 14, the top canonical pathways included oxidative phosphorylation, the protein ubiquitination pathway, natural killer cell signaling, and B-cell development. Biomarkers were identified that differentiate between vaccinees and control subjects, at early, intermediate, and late stages of the development of immunity as well as markers which were common to all 3 stages following vaccination but distinct from the sham-vaccinated control subjects. The study represents a novel examination of molecular processes that lead to the development of immunity against VEEV in humans and which may be of value as diagnostic targets, to enhance modern vaccine design, or molecular correlates of protection.","Genes down-regulated in blood vaccinated vs control in adults (23-48) after exposure to Live attenuated vaccine TC-83 , time point 2D","Erwin-Cohen RA,Porter AI,Pittman PR,Rossi CA,DaSilva L",27870591,HUMAN_GENE_SYMBOL,"ABAT,BRI3BP,CAMK1D,CD24,CEP68,CXCL8,DIP2A,DPY19L3,FCER1A,FCHO2,FRY,GPR27,GRAMD1C,H2AZ2,IGF1R,IRS2,ITM2A,KBTBD7,LINC01215,PDZD8,PIGX,RFLNB,RNF141,RRAGD,RUNX2,SGK1,SH3YL1,STEAP4,STXBP5,THBD,TMCC3,TP53INP1",32,"ABAT,BRI3BP,CAMK1D,CD24,CEP68,CXCL8,DIP2A,DPY19L3,FCER1A,FCHO2,FRY,GPR27,GRAMD1C,H2AZ2,IGF1R,IRS2,ITM2A,KBTBD7,LINC01215,PDZD8,PIGX,RFLNB,RNF141,RRAGD,RUNX2,SGK1,SH3YL1,STEAP4,STXBP5,THBD,TMCC3,TP53INP1",C7:VAX,HIPC SIGNATURES,NIAID/HIPC SIGNATURES,Suppl Table 1,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4946173/bin/mmc1.docx,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: We assessed transcriptional messenger RNA expression changes in 197 recipients of primary smallpox vaccination representing the extremes of humoral and cellular immune responses. RESULTS: The 20 most significant differentially expressed genes include a tumor necrosis factor-receptor superfamily member, an interferon (IFN) gene, a chemokine gene, zinc finger protein genes, nuclear factors, and histones (P <= 1.06E(-20), q <= 2.64E(-17)). A pathway analysis identified 4 enriched pathways with cytokine production by the T-helper 17 subset of CD4+ T cells being the most significant pathway (P = 3.42E(-05)). Two pathways (antiviral actions of IFNs, P = 8.95E(-05); and IFN-alpha/beta signaling pathway, P = 2.92E(-04)), integral to innate immunity, were enriched when comparing high with low antibody responders (false discovery rate, < 0.05). Genes related to immune function and transcription (TLR8, P =.0002; DAPP1, P =.0003; LAMP3, P = 9.96E(-05); NR4A2, P <= .0002; EGR3, P = 4.52E(-05)), and other genes with a possible impact on immunity (LNPEP, P = 3.72E(-05); CAPRIN1, P =.0001; XRN1, P =.0001), were found to be expressed differentially in high versus low antibody responders. CONCLUSION: We identified novel and known immunity-related genes and pathways that may account for differences in immune response to smallpox vaccination.","Genes up-regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cell stimulated vs unstimulated in adults (18-40) after exposure to Dryvax , time point 9 to 34M.

METHODS: We performed a transcriptome(mRNA-Seq)-profiling study after in vitro viral stimulation of PBMCs from 30 measles vaccine recipients, selected from a cohort of 764 schoolchildren, based on the highest and lowest antibody titers. We used regression and network biology modeling to define markers associated with neutralizing antibody response. RESULTS: We identified 39 differentially expressed genes that demonstrate significant differences between the high and low antibody responder groups (p-value <= 0.0002, q-value <= 0.092), including the top gene CD93 (p < 1.0E-13, q < 1.0E-09), encoding a receptor required for antigen-driven B-cell differentiation, maintenance of immunoglobulin production and preservation of plasma cells in the bone marrow. Network biology modeling highlighted plasma cell survival (CD93, IL6, CXCL12), chemokine/cytokine activity and cell-cell communication/adhesion/migration as biological processes associated with the observed differential response in the two responder groups. CONCLUSION: We identified genes and pathways that explain in part, and are associated with, neutralizing antibody titers after measles vaccination. This new knowledge could assist in the identification of biomarkers and predictive signatures of protective immunity that may be useful in the design of new vaccine candidates and in clinical

METHODS: We performed a transcriptome(mRNA-Seq)-profiling study after in vitro viral stimulation of PBMCs from 30 measles vaccine recipients, selected from a cohort of 764 schoolchildren, based on the highest and lowest antibody titers. We used regression and network biology modeling to define markers associated with neutralizing antibody response. RESULTS: We identified 39 differentially expressed genes that demonstrate significant differences between the high and low antibody responder groups (p-value <= 0.0002, q-value <= 0.092), including the top gene CD93 (p < 1.0E-13, q < 1.0E-09), encoding a receptor required for antigen-driven B-cell differentiation, maintenance of immunoglobulin production and preservation of plasma cells in the bone marrow. Network biology modeling highlighted plasma cell survival (CD93, IL6, CXCL12), chemokine/cytokine activity and cell-cell communication/adhesion/migration as biological processes associated with the observed differential response in the two responder groups. CONCLUSION: We identified genes and pathways that explain in part, and are associated with, neutralizing antibody titers after measles vaccination. This new knowledge could assist in the identification of biomarkers and predictive signatures of protective immunity that may be useful in the design of new vaccine candidates and in clinical

Because BCG vaccination is used extensively in infants, this population group is likely to be the first in which efficacy trials of new vaccines will be conducted. However, our understanding of the complexity of immunity to BCG in infants is inadequate, making interpretation of vaccine-induced immune responses difficult. METHODS: To better understand BCG-induced immunity, we performed gene expression profiling in five 10-week old infants routinely vaccinated with BCG at birth. RNA was extracted from 12 hour BCG-stimulated or purified protein derivative of tuberculin (PPD)-stimulated PBMC, isolated from neonatal blood collected 10 weeks after vaccination. RNA was hybridised to the Sentrix(R) HumanRef-8 Expression BeadChip (Illumina) to measure expression of > 16,000 genes. RESULTS: We found that ex vivo stimulation of PBMC with PPD and BCG induced largely similar gene expression profiles, except that BCG induced greater macrophage activation. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway, including PPAR-gamma, involved in activation of the alternative, anti-inflammatory macrophage response was down-regulated following stimulation with both antigens. In contrast, up-regulation of genes associated with the classic, pro-inflammatory macrophage response was noted. Further analysis revealed a decrease in the expression of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), including integrin alpha M (ITGAM), which is known to be important for entry of mycobacteria into the macrophage.

Because BCG vaccination is used extensively in infants, this population group is likely to be the first in which efficacy trials of new vaccines will be conducted. However, our understanding of the complexity of immunity to BCG in infants is inadequate, making interpretation of vaccine-induced immune responses difficult. METHODS: To better understand BCG-induced immunity, we performed gene expression profiling in five 10-week old infants routinely vaccinated with BCG at birth. RNA was extracted from 12 hour BCG-stimulated or purified protein derivative of tuberculin (PPD)-stimulated PBMC, isolated from neonatal blood collected 10 weeks after vaccination. RNA was hybridised to the Sentrix(R) HumanRef-8 Expression BeadChip (Illumina) to measure expression of > 16,000 genes. RESULTS: We found that ex vivo stimulation of PBMC with PPD and BCG induced largely similar gene expression profiles, except that BCG induced greater macrophage activation. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway, including PPAR-gamma, involved in activation of the alternative, anti-inflammatory macrophage response was down-regulated following stimulation with both antigens. In contrast, up-regulation of genes associated with the classic, pro-inflammatory macrophage response was noted. Further analysis revealed a decrease in the expression of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), including integrin alpha M (ITGAM), which is known to be important for entry of mycobacteria into the macrophage. Interestingly, more leukocyte genes were down-regulated than up-regulated. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that a combination of suppressed and up-regulated genes may be key in determining development of protective immunity to TB induced by vaccination with BCG.","Genes up-regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cell stimulated vs unstimulated in infants (10w) after exposure to BCG (Danish strain BCG Statens Serum Institut, Denmark) , time point 10W.

Microarray analysis and Luminex assay were applied to examine mRNA expression and Th1/Th2/Th9/Th17/Th22/Treg cytokine and chemokine profiles in non-responders and responders. Differentially expressed genes in PBMCs of non-responders at 5 time points, i.e. pre-vaccination, 3<sup>rd</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup>, 28<sup>th</sup> day post the first dose vaccination and 7<sup>th</sup> day post the second dose vaccination indicated a dense network trend. Compared with responders, nine coding genes (BPI, DEFA1B, DEFA4, CEACAM8, MMP8, FOLR3, LTF, TCN1 and TKTL1) were significantly up-regulated in non-responders at all 5 time points, which could probably be the characteristic genes in hepatitis B vaccine non-responsiveness. Gene ontology analysis revealed that most of the DEGs were related with immune responses. Validation results of these 9 genes using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were mostly consistent with the results of microarray. Cytokine analysis demonstrated that IL-27 and CXCL12 concentrations in responders were significantly higher than non-responders on the 3<sup>rd</sup> day after the first dose and 7<sup>th</sup> day after the second dose of vaccination, respectively.

Subsequent controlled human malaria challenge (CHMI) of the vaccinees with <i>Plasmodium</i>-infected mosquitoes, 3 wk after the final immunization, resulted in ~50% protection in both groups of vaccinees. Circumsporozoite protein (CSP)-specific antibody titers, prechallenge, were associated with protection in the RRR group. In contrast, ARR-induced lower antibody responses, and protection was associated with polyfunctional CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses 2 wk after priming with Ad35. Molecular signatures of B and plasma cells detected in PBMCs were highly correlated with antibody titers prechallenge and protection in the RRR cohort. In contrast, early signatures of innate immunity and dendritic cell activation were highly associated with protection in the ARR cohort. For both vaccine regimens, natural killer (NK) cell signatures negatively correlated with and predicted protection. These results suggest that protective immunity against <i>P. falciparum</i> can be achieved via multiple mechanisms and highlight the utility of systems approaches in defining molecular correlates of protection to vaccination.","Genes up-regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cell immunized with ARR vs immunized by RRR in unknown (primary immunization with recombinant adenovirus 35 (Ad35)) after exposure to P. falciparum RTS,S/AS01 , time point 1D","Kazmin D,Nakaya HI,Lee EK,Johnson MJ,van der Most R,van den Berg RA,Ballou WR,Jongert E,Wille-Reece U,Ockenhouse C,Aderem A,Zak DE,Sadoff J,Hendriks J,Wrammert J,Ahmed R,Pulendran B",28193898,HUMAN_GENE_SYMBOL,"EPHB2,HESX1,IFI27,IFI44L,IFI6,LGALS3BP,LINC00487,LY6E,SERPING1,SIGLEC1",10,"EPHB2,HESX1,IFI27,IFI44L,IFI6,LGALS3BP,LINC00487,LY6E,SERPING1,SIGLEC1",C7:VAX,HIPC SIGNATURES,NIAID/HIPC SIGNATURES,Suppl Table 1,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3528489/bin/1208972109_sd01.xlsx,NA,NA,NA,NA

Subsequent controlled human malaria challenge (CHMI) of the vaccinees with <i>Plasmodium</i>-infected mosquitoes, 3 wk after the final immunization, resulted in ~50% protection in both groups of vaccinees. Circumsporozoite protein (CSP)-specific antibody titers, prechallenge, were associated with protection in the RRR group. In contrast, ARR-induced lower antibody responses, and protection was associated with polyfunctional CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses 2 wk after priming with Ad35. Molecular signatures of B and plasma cells detected in PBMCs were highly correlated with antibody titers prechallenge and protection in the RRR cohort. In contrast, early signatures of innate immunity and dendritic cell activation were highly associated with protection in the ARR cohort.

Analysis of the transcriptome of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is essential to elucidate the characteristics of gene expression in non-responders. In this study, we enrolled seven responders who had received three injections and seven non-responders who had six injections of hepatitis B vaccine before. All the participants were then vaccinated with a three-dose boost regimen. Microarray analysis and Luminex assay were applied to examine mRNA expression and Th1/Th2/Th9/Th17/Th22/Treg cytokine and chemokine profiles in non-responders and responders. Differentially expressed genes in PBMCs of non-responders at 5 time points, i.e. pre-vaccination, 3<sup>rd</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup>, 28<sup>th</sup> day post the first dose vaccination and 7<sup>th</sup> day post the second dose vaccination indicated a dense network trend. Compared with responders, nine coding genes (BPI, DEFA1B, DEFA4, CEACAM8, MMP8, FOLR3, LTF, TCN1 and TKTL1) were significantly up-regulated in non-responders at all 5 time points, which could probably be the characteristic genes in hepatitis B vaccine non-responsiveness. Gene ontology analysis revealed that most of the DEGs were related with immune responses. Validation results of these 9 genes using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were mostly consistent with the results of microarray. Cytokine analysis demonstrated that IL-27 and CXCL12 concentrations in responders were significantly higher than non-responders on the 3<sup>rd</sup> day after the first dose and 7<sup>th</sup> day after the second dose of vaccination, respectively. No significant difference was observed in other cytokine and chemokine signatures between the two groups. In conclusion, our results revealed characteristic transcriptome and cytokine changes in hepatitis B vaccine non-responders after boost immunization.","Genes up-regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cell non-responders vs responders in adults (<50) after exposure to Heptatitis B surface antigen vaccine (HBsAg) , time point 0, 3, 7, 28 and 35 jointly.

Fourteen healthy volunteers aged 18-45 years were immunized intramuscularly three times at 1-month intervals and whole blood samples were collected at baseline, 6 h, and 1, 3, and 7 days post first immunization. Subtle changes in the transcriptomic profiles were observed following immunization, ranging from over 300 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at day 1 to nearly 100 DEGs at day 7 following immunization.

Diverse CN54gp140-specific serum antibody responses of the subjects enabled their categorization into high or low responders, at early ( < 1 month) and late (up to 6 months) time points post vaccination. BTM analyses revealed repression of modules enriched in NK cells, and the mitochondrial electron chain, in individuals with high or sustained antigen-specific antibody responses. However, low responders showed an enhancement of BTMs associated with enrichment in myeloid cells and monocytes as well as integrin cell surface interactions.

Functional pathway analysis revealed blood transcription modules (BTMs) related to general cell cycle activation, and innate immune cell activation at early time points, as well as BTMs related to T cells and B cell activation at the later time points post-immunization. Diverse CN54gp140-specific serum antibody responses of the subjects enabled their categorization into high or low responders, at early ( < 1 month) and late (up to 6 months) time points post vaccination. BTM analyses revealed repression of modules enriched in NK cells, and the mitochondrial electron chain, in individuals with high or sustained antigen-specific antibody responses. However, low responders showed an enhancement of BTMs associated with enrichment in myeloid cells and monocytes as well as integrin cell surface interactions. Flow cytometry analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from the subjects revealed an enhanced frequency of CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cells in the majority of vaccines 14 days after vaccination as compared with the baseline.

Because BCG vaccination is used extensively in infants, this population group is likely to be the first in which efficacy trials of new vaccines will be conducted. However, our understanding of the complexity of immunity to BCG in infants is inadequate, making interpretation of vaccine-induced immune responses difficult. METHODS: To better understand BCG-induced immunity, we performed gene expression profiling in five 10-week old infants routinely vaccinated with BCG at birth. RNA was extracted from 12 hour BCG-stimulated or purified protein derivative of tuberculin (PPD)-stimulated PBMC, isolated from neonatal blood collected 10 weeks after vaccination. RNA was hybridised to the Sentrix(R) HumanRef-8 Expression BeadChip (Illumina) to measure expression of > 16,000 genes. RESULTS: We found that ex vivo stimulation of PBMC with PPD and BCG induced largely similar gene expression profiles, except that BCG induced greater macrophage activation. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway, including PPAR-gamma, involved in activation of the alternative, anti-inflammatory macrophage response was down-regulated following stimulation with both antigens. In contrast, up-regulation of genes associated with the classic, pro-inflammatory macrophage response was noted. Further analysis revealed a decrease in the expression of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), including integrin alpha M (ITGAM), which is known to be important for entry of mycobacteria into the macrophage. Interestingly, more leukocyte genes were down-regulated than up-regulated. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that a combination of suppressed and up-regulated genes may be key in determining development of protective immunity to TB induced by vaccination with BCG.","Genes down-regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cell stimulated vs unstimulated in infants (10w) after exposure to BCG (Danish strain BCG Statens Serum Institut, Denmark) , time point 10W.

Here we show, using transcriptional and cytometric profiling of whole blood collected before vaccination, that heightened expression of genes that augment B-cell responses and higher memory B-cell frequencies correlate with stronger responses to HBV vaccine. In contrast, higher levels of inflammatory response transcripts and increased frequencies of pro-inflammatory innate cells correlate with weaker responses to this vaccine. Increased numbers of erythrocytes and the haem-induced response also correlate with poor response to the HBV vaccine. A transcriptomics-based pre-vaccination predictor of response to HBV vaccine is built and validated in distinct sets of older adults. This moderately accurate (area under the curve ~65%) but robust signature is supported by flow cytometry and cytokine profiling. This study is the first that identifies baseline predictors and mechanisms of response to the HBV vaccine.","Genes down-regulated in blood responders vs poor responders in adults (25-83) (responders)

In this study hepatitis B virus (HBV)-naive older adults received three vaccines, including one against HBV. Here we show, using transcriptional and cytometric profiling of whole blood collected before vaccination, that heightened expression of genes that augment B-cell responses and higher memory B-cell frequencies correlate with stronger responses to HBV vaccine. In contrast, higher levels of inflammatory response transcripts and increased frequencies of pro-inflammatory innate cells correlate with weaker responses to this vaccine. Increased numbers of erythrocytes and the haem-induced response also correlate with poor response to the HBV vaccine. A transcriptomics-based pre-vaccination predictor of response to HBV vaccine is built and validated in distinct sets of older adults. This moderately accurate (area under the curve ~65%) but robust signature is supported by flow cytometry and cytokine profiling.

Most vaccines utilized in the elderly contain antigens, which the target population has had previous contact with due to previous vaccination or infection. Therefore, most studies investigating vaccine-induced immune responses in the elderly do not analyze responses to neo-antigens but rather booster responses. However, age-related differences in the immune response could differentially affect primary versus recall responses. We therefore investigated the impact of age on primary and recall antibody responses following hepatitis B vaccination in young and older adults. Focused gene expression profiling was performed before and 1 day after the vaccination in order to identify gene signatures predicting antibody responses. Young (20-40 years; <i>n</i> = 24) and elderly ( > 60 years; <i>n</i> = 17) healthy volunteers received either a primary series (no prior vaccination) or a single booster shot (documented primary vaccination more than 10 years ago). Antibody titers were determined at days 0, 7, and 28, as well as 6 months after the vaccination. After primary vaccination, antibody responses were lower and delayed in the elderly compared to young adults. Non-responders after the three-dose primary series were only observed in the elderly group. Maximum antibody concentrations after booster vaccination were similar in both age groups. Focused gene expression profiling identified 29 transcripts that correlated with age at baseline and clustered in a network centered around type I interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines. In addition, smaller 8- and 6-gene signatures were identified at baseline that associated with vaccine responsiveness during primary and booster vaccination, respectively. When evaluating the kinetic changes in gene expression profiles before and after primary vaccination, a 33-gene signature, dominated by IFN-signaling, pro-inflammatory cytokines, inflammasome components, and immune cell subset markers, was uncovered that was associated with vaccine responsiveness. By contrast, no such transcripts were identified during booster vaccination. Our results document that primary differs from booster vaccination in old age, in regard to antibody responses as well as at the level of gene signatures.

Although neutralizing Ab titers are thought to be the main effectors of protection against infection, early predictors of long-term efficacy are not yet defined and a comprehensive understanding of innate and adaptive immune responses to vaccination is still lacking. Here, microarrays were used to compare the gene expression signature in HPV-16 L1 VLP-stimulated PBMCs from 17 vaccine and 4 placebo recipients before vaccination and 1 mo after receiving the second immunization. Vaccination with a monovalent HPV-16 L1 VLP vaccine was associated with modulation of genes involved in the inflammatory/defense response, cytokine, IFN, and cell cycle pathways in VLP-stimulated PBMCs. Additionally, there was up-regulation of probesets associated with cytotoxic (GZMB, TNFSF10) and regulatory (INDO, CTLA4) activities. The strongest correlations with neutralizing Ab titers were found for cyclin D2 (CCND2) and galectin (LGALS2). Twenty-two differentially expressed probesets were selected for confirmation by RT-PCR in an independent sample set. Agreement with microarray data was seen for more than two-thirds of these probesets. Up-regulation of immune/defense response genes by HPV-16 L1 VLP, in particular, IFN-induced genes, was observed in PBMCs collected before vaccination, with many of these genes being further induced following vaccination. In conclusion, we identified important innate and adaptive response-related genes induced by vaccination with HPV-16 L1 VLP. Further studies are needed to identify gene expression signatures of immunogenicity and long-term protection with potential utility in prediction of long-term HPV vaccination outcomes in clinical trials.","Genes negatively correlated with antibody response in peripheral blood mononuclear cell in young adults (18-25) after exposure to HPV-16 L1 VLP , time point 12M.

One subgroup was re-vaccinated in 2012/13 within 6-9 months of their 2011/12 vaccination, the other received the two doses of vaccine in the typical ~12 month interval. Unexpectedly the sub-cohort with early revaccination exhibited significantly increased response rates and antibody titers to TIV compared to their normally re-vaccinated aged counter parts. Microarray analyses of gene expression in whole blood RNA taken at the day of the 2012/13 re-vaccination revealed statistically significant differences in expression of 754 genes between the individuals with early re-vaccination compared to subjects vaccinated in a normal 12 month interval. These observations suggest that TIV has long-lasting effects on the immune system affecting B cell responses as well as the transcriptome of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and this residual effect may augment vaccination response in patients where the effect of the previous vaccination has not yet diminished.","Genes down-regulated in blood cohort 1 (re-vaccinated in 6-9 months) vs cohort 2 (re-vaccinated in 12-13 months) in adults (65+) after exposure to 2012-2013 seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) , time point N/A.

One subgroup was re-vaccinated in 2012/13 within 6-9 months of their 2011/12 vaccination, the other received the two doses of vaccine in the typical ~12 month interval. Unexpectedly the sub-cohort with early revaccination exhibited significantly increased response rates and antibody titers to TIV compared to their normally re-vaccinated aged counter parts. Microarray analyses of gene expression in whole blood RNA taken at the day of the 2012/13 re-vaccination revealed statistically significant differences in expression of 754 genes between the individuals with early re-vaccination compared to subjects vaccinated in a normal 12 month interval. These observations suggest that TIV has long-lasting effects on the immune system affecting B cell responses as well as the transcriptome of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and this residual effect may augment vaccination response in patients where the effect of the previous vaccination has not yet diminished.","Genes up-regulated in blood cohort 1 (re-vaccinated in 6-9 months) vs cohort 2 (re-vaccinated in 12-13 months) in adults (65+) after exposure to 2012-2013 seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) , time point N/A.

Although neutralizing Ab titers are thought to be the main effectors of protection against infection, early predictors of long-term efficacy are not yet defined and a comprehensive understanding of innate and adaptive immune responses to vaccination is still lacking. Here, microarrays were used to compare the gene expression signature in HPV-16 L1 VLP-stimulated PBMCs from 17 vaccine and 4 placebo recipients before vaccination and 1 mo after receiving the second immunization. Vaccination with a monovalent HPV-16 L1 VLP vaccine was associated with modulation of genes involved in the inflammatory/defense response, cytokine, IFN, and cell cycle pathways in VLP-stimulated PBMCs. Additionally, there was up-regulation of probesets associated with cytotoxic (GZMB, TNFSF10) and regulatory (INDO, CTLA4) activities. The strongest correlations with neutralizing Ab titers were found for cyclin D2 (CCND2) and galectin (LGALS2). Twenty-two differentially expressed probesets were selected for confirmation by RT-PCR in an independent sample set. Agreement with microarray data was seen for more than two-thirds of these probesets. Up-regulation of immune/defense response genes by HPV-16 L1 VLP, in particular, IFN-induced genes, was observed in PBMCs collected before vaccination, with many of these genes being further induced following vaccination. In conclusion, we identified important innate and adaptive response-related genes induced by vaccination with HPV-16 L1 VLP. Further studies are needed to identify gene expression signatures of immunogenicity and long-term protection with potential utility in prediction of long-term HPV vaccination outcomes in clinical trials.","Genes down-regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cell 2m vs 0m in young adults (18-25) after exposure to HPV-16 L1 VLP , time point 2M.

Twenty-two differentially expressed probesets were selected for confirmation by RT-PCR in an independent sample set. Agreement with microarray data was seen for more than two-thirds of these probesets. Up-regulation of immune/defense response genes by HPV-16 L1 VLP, in particular, IFN-induced genes, was observed in PBMCs collected before vaccination, with many of these genes being further induced following vaccination. In conclusion, we identified important innate and adaptive response-related genes induced by vaccination with HPV-16 L1 VLP. Further studies are needed to identify gene expression signatures of immunogenicity and long-term protection with potential utility in prediction of long-term HPV vaccination outcomes in clinical trials.","Genes up-regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cell 2m vs 0m in young adults (18-25) after exposure to HPV-16 L1 VLP , time point 2M.

Modified vaccinia virus Ankara expressing antigen 85A (MVA85A) is a novel tuberculosis vaccine candidate designed to enhance responses induced by BCG. Antigen-specific interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production is greatly enhanced by MVA85A, however the variability between healthy individuals is extensive. In this study we have sought to characterize the early changes in gene expression in humans following vaccination with MVA85A and relate these to long-term immunogenicity. Two days post-vaccination, MVA85A induces a strong interferon and inflammatory response. Separating volunteers into high and low responders on the basis of T cell responses to 85A peptides measured during the trial, an expansion of circulating CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ cells is seen in low but not high responders. Additionally, high levels of Toll-like Receptor (TLR) 1 on day of vaccination are associated with an increased response to antigen 85A. In a classification model, combined expression levels of TLR1, TICAM2 and CD14 on day of vaccination and CTLA4 and IL2Ralpha two days post-vaccination can classify high and low responders with over 80% accuracy. Furthermore, administering MVA85A in mice with anti-TLR2 antibodies may abrogate high responses, and neutralising antibodies to TLRs 1, 2 or 6 or HMGB1 decrease CXCL2 production during in vitro stimulation with MVA85A. HMGB1 is released into the supernatant following atimulation with MVA85A and we propose this signal may be the trigger activating the TLR pathway. This study suggests an important role for an endogenous ligand in innate sensing of MVA and demonstrates the importance of pattern recognition receptors and regulatory T cell responses in determining the magnitude of the antigen specific immune response to vaccination with MVA85A in humans.","Genes up-regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cell high responders vs low responders in adult (18-55) after exposure to Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) virus vaccine vector , time point 0D.

Modified vaccinia virus Ankara expressing antigen 85A (MVA85A) is a novel tuberculosis vaccine candidate designed to enhance responses induced by BCG. Antigen-specific interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production is greatly enhanced by MVA85A, however the variability between healthy individuals is extensive. In this study we have sought to characterize the early changes in gene expression in humans following vaccination with MVA85A and relate these to long-term immunogenicity. Two days post-vaccination, MVA85A induces a strong interferon and inflammatory response. Separating volunteers into high and low responders on the basis of T cell responses to 85A peptides measured during the trial, an expansion of circulating CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ cells is seen in low but not high responders. Additionally, high levels of Toll-like Receptor (TLR) 1 on day of vaccination are associated with an increased response to antigen 85A. In a classification model, combined expression levels of TLR1, TICAM2 and CD14 on day of vaccination and CTLA4 and IL2Ralpha two days post-vaccination can classify high and low responders with over 80% accuracy. Furthermore, administering MVA85A in mice with anti-TLR2 antibodies may abrogate high responses, and neutralising antibodies to TLRs 1, 2 or 6 or HMGB1 decrease CXCL2 production during in vitro stimulation with MVA85A. HMGB1 is released into the supernatant following atimulation with MVA85A and we propose this signal may be the trigger activating the TLR pathway. This study suggests an important role for an endogenous ligand in innate sensing of MVA and demonstrates the importance of pattern recognition receptors and regulatory T cell responses in determining the magnitude of the antigen specific immune response to vaccination with MVA85A in humans.","Genes up-regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cell low responders vs high responders in adults (18-55) after exposure to Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) virus vaccine vector , time point 2D.

When applied iteratively, the findings may permit selection of HIV vaccine candidates eliciting innate immune response profiles more likely to drive HIV protective immunity.","Genes positively correlated with CD8+ T-cell response in peripheral blood mononuclear cell in adults (20-50) after exposure to MRKAd5 HIV-1 gag/pol/nef , time point 3D","Zak DE,Andersen-Nissen E,Peterson ER,Sato A,Hamilton MK,Borgerding J,Krishnamurty AT,Chang JT,Adams DJ,Hensley TR,Salter AI,Morgan CA,Duerr AC,De Rosa SC,Aderem A,McElrath MJ",23151505,HUMAN_GENE_SYMBOL,"ANKRD10-IT1,ANKRD12,ARHGAP12,ARID4A,ATRX,GOLM2,CCDC186,CCNT1,CDK8,CEBPZOS,CLEC2D,CTDSPL2,DENND4C,DHFR,ESCO1,ESF1,FAM172A,ATOSA,FBXO11,FYTTD1,GARS1-DT,GCC2,GNG11,GOLGA4,GTF2H3,HAUS3,HAUS6,HNRNPA3,HOOK3,KDM3A,KIF2A,KIN,KIR2DL1,KTN1,LCOR,LMAN1,LRRC37B,MAP4K5,MGAT4A,MIER3,MIS12,PCGF5,PCNP,PDGFD,PIGK,PIK3R1,PLEKHA1,PRKAR2B,PTPN22,RAMAC,RASA2,COP1,SBDS,SH2D1B,SINHCAF,SLC16A6,SLC25A40,SLC30A9,SMURF2,SNRNP27,THAP9-AS1,TRAJ40,TRAV13-1,TRGC2,TRGJP1,TRPM7,SNORD28,WASHC2C,ZBTB44,ZNF131,ZNF134,ZNF280D,ZNF431,ZNF484,ZNF486,ZNF507,ZNF510,ZNF518A,ZNF654,ZNF721,ZNF761,ZNF765,ZNF845,ZNHIT6",84,"ANKRD10-IT1,ANKRD12,ARHGAP12,ARID4A,ATRX,CASC4,CCDC186,CCNT1,CDK8,CEBPZOS,CLEC2D,CTDSPL2,DENND4C,DHFR,ESCO1,ESF1,FAM172A,FAM214A,FBXO11,FYTTD1,GARS1-DT,GCC2,GNG11,GOLGA4,GTF2H3,HAUS3,HAUS6,HNRNPA3,HOOK3,KDM3A,KIF2A,KIN,KIR2DL1,KTN1,LCOR,LMAN1,LRRC37B,MAP4K5,MGAT4A,MIER3,MIS12,PCGF5,PCNP,PDGFD,PIGK,PIK3R1,PLEKHA1,PRKAR2B,PTPN22,RAMAC,RASA2,RFWD2,SBDS,SH2D1B,SINHCAF,SLC16A6,SLC25A40,SLC30A9,SMURF2,SNRNP27,THAP9-AS1,TRAJ40,TRAV13-1,TRGC2,TRGJP1,TRPM7,U28,WASHC2C,ZBTB44,ZNF131,ZNF134,ZNF280D,ZNF431,ZNF484,ZNF486,ZNF507,ZNF510,ZNF518A,ZNF654,ZNF721,ZNF761,ZNF765,ZNF845,ZNHIT6",C7:VAX,HIPC SIGNATURES,NIAID/HIPC SIGNATURES,Suppl Table 2,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5834766/bin/Table_2.XLSX,NA,NA,NA,NA

Results of the first Phase 2b efficacy trial of a candidate vaccine, MVA85A, evaluated in BCG-vaccinated infants were published last year. Although no improvement in efficacy above BCG alone was seen, cryopreserved samples from this trial provide an opportunity to study the immune response to vaccination in this population. METHODS: We investigated blood samples taken before vaccination (baseline) and one and 28 days post-vaccination with MVA85A or placebo (Candin). The IFN-gamma ELISpot assay was performed at baseline and on day 28 to quantify the adaptive response to Ag85A peptides. Gene expression analysis was performed at all three timepoints to identify early gene signatures predictive of the magnitude of the subsequent adaptive T cell response using the significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) statistical package and gene set enrichment analysis. RESULTS: One day post-MVA85A, there is an induction of inflammatory pathways compared to placebo samples. Modules associated with myeloid cells and inflammation pre- and one day post-MVA85A correlate with a higher IFN-gamma ELISpot response post-vaccination. By contrast, previous work done in UK adults shows early inflammation in this population is not associated with a strong T cell response but that induction of regulatory pathways inversely correlates with the magnitude of the T cell response. This may be indicative of important mechanistic differences in how T cell responses develop in these two populations following vaccination with MVA85A. CONCLUSION: The results suggest the capacity of MVA85A to induce a strong innate response is key to the initiation of an adaptive immune response in South African infants but induction of regulatory pathways may be more important in UK adults. Understanding differences in immune response to vaccination between populations is likely to be an important aspect of developing successful vaccines and vaccination strategies.

It is the most advanced EBOV candidate currently in the licensure process. The experimental vaccine was again administered as response to outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo. However, underlying molecular mechanisms that convey protection remain incompletely understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are known key regulators that influence gene expression on a post-transcriptional level. The miRNA-mediated control has emerged as a critical regulatory principle in the immune system, which strongly influences the balance of innate and adaptive immune responses by modulation of signaling pathways critical for differentiation of immune cells. We investigated expression levels of circulating miRNAs (c-miRNAs) in plasma from healthy vaccinees, as they may reflect cellular dynamics following VSV-EBOV immunization and additionally may serve as potential biomarkers for vaccine efficacy. As part of the WHO-led VEBCON consortium, we investigated safety and immunogenicity of VSV-EBOV in a phase I trial. A comprehensive analysis of expression levels on c-miRNAs from plasma samples following VSV-EBOV immunization (day 0, 1, 3 post vaccination) was conducted using RT-qPCR assays. Potential biological relevance was assessed using in silico analyses. Additionally, we correlated dynamics of miRNA expressions with our previously reported data on vaccine-induced antibody and cytokine responses and finally evaluated the prognostic power by generating ROC curves. We identified four promising miRNAs (hsa-miR-146a, hsa-miR-126, hsa-miR-199a, hsa-miR-484), showing a strong association with adaptive immune responses, exhibited favourable prognostic performance and are implicated in immunology-related functions. Our results provide evidence that miRNAs may serve as useful biomarkers for prediction of vaccine-induced immunogenicity. Furthermore, our unique data set provides insight into molecular mechanisms that underlie VSV-EBOV-mediated protective immune responses, which may help to decipher VSV-EBOV immune signature and accelerate strategic vaccine design or personalized approaches.","Genes down-regulated in blood plasma 3d vs 0d in adults (18-55) (high dose) after exposure to rVSV-EBOV , time point 3D","Fischer T,Spohn M,Olearo F,Zinser ME,Kasonta R,Stubbe HC,Rechtien A,Ly ML,Schmiedel S,Lohse AW,Grundhoff A,VEBCON (VSV-Ebola Consortium),Addo MM,Dahlke C",30244872,HUMAN_GENE_SYMBOL,"MIR126,MIR199A2,MIR221,MIR23A,MIR24-1,MIR30D",6,"MIR126,MIR199A2,MIR221,MIR23A,MIR24-1,MIR30D",C7:VAX,HIPC SIGNATURES,NIAID/HIPC SIGNATURES,Fig 5A,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5962691/figure/F5/,NA,NA,NA,NA

Lack of effective or appropriately targeted cell mediated immunity, including CD8+ T cell responses, underlies the progression of VL and progression to PKDL, and can limit the therapeutic efficacy of anti-leishmanial drugs. Hence, in addition to the need for prophylactic vaccines against leishmaniasis, the development of therapeutic vaccines for use alone or in combined immuno-chemotherapy has been identified as an unmet clinical need. Here, we report the first clinical trial of a third-generation leishmaniasis vaccine, developed intentionally to induce Leishmania-specific CD8+ T cells. METHODS: We conducted a first-in-human dose escalation Phase I trial in 20 healthy volunteers to assess the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a prime-only adenoviral vaccine for human VL and PKDL. ChAd63-KH is a replication defective simian adenovirus expressing a novel synthetic gene (KH) encoding two Leishmania proteins KMP-11 and HASPB. Uniquely, the latter was engineered to reflect repeat domain polymorphisms and arrangements identified from clinical isolates. We monitored innate immune responses by whole blood RNA-Seq and antigen specific CD8+ T cell responses by IFN-gamma ELISPOT and intracellular flow cytometry. FINDINGS: ChAd63-KH was safe at intramuscular doses of 1x1010 and 7.5x1010 vp. Whole blood transcriptomic profiling indicated that ChAd63-KH induced innate immune responses characterized by an interferon signature and the presence of activated dendritic cells. Broad and quantitatively robust CD8+ T cell responses were induced by vaccination in 100% (20/20) of vaccinated subjects. CONCLUSION: The results of this study support the further development of ChAd63-KH as a novel third generation vaccine for VL and PKDL. TRIAL: This clinical trial (LEISH1) was registered at EudraCT (2012-005596-14) and ISRCTN (07766359).","Genes up-regulated in blood 24hr vs 0hr in adults (18-50) (high dose subjects) after exposure to ChAd63-KH , time point 24H , administered Intramuscular injection.

Lack of effective or appropriately targeted cell mediated immunity, including CD8+ T cell responses, underlies the progression of VL and progression to PKDL, and can limit the therapeutic efficacy of anti-leishmanial drugs. Hence, in addition to the need for prophylactic vaccines against leishmaniasis, the development of therapeutic vaccines for use alone or in combined immuno-chemotherapy has been identified as an unmet clinical need. Here, we report the first clinical trial of a third-generation leishmaniasis vaccine, developed intentionally to induce Leishmania-specific CD8+ T cells. METHODS: We conducted a first-in-human dose escalation Phase I trial in 20 healthy volunteers to assess the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a prime-only adenoviral vaccine for human VL and PKDL. ChAd63-KH is a replication defective simian adenovirus expressing a novel synthetic gene (KH) encoding two Leishmania proteins KMP-11 and HASPB. Uniquely, the latter was engineered to reflect repeat domain polymorphisms and arrangements identified from clinical isolates. We monitored innate immune responses by whole blood RNA-Seq and antigen specific CD8+ T cell responses by IFN-gamma ELISPOT and intracellular flow cytometry. FINDINGS: ChAd63-KH was safe at intramuscular doses of 1x1010 and 7.5x1010 vp. Whole blood transcriptomic profiling indicated that ChAd63-KH induced innate immune responses characterized by an interferon signature and the presence of activated dendritic cells. Broad and quantitatively robust CD8+ T cell responses were induced by vaccination in 100% (20/20) of vaccinated subjects. CONCLUSION: The results of this study support the further development of ChAd63-KH as a novel third generation vaccine for VL and PKDL. TRIAL: This clinical trial (LEISH1) was registered at EudraCT (2012-005596-14) and ISRCTN (07766359).","Genes down-regulated in blood 24hr vs 0hr in adults (18-50) (high dose subjects) after exposure to ChAd63-KH , time point 24H , administered Intramuscular injection.

Within 24 h, striking increases in peripheral blood mononuclear cell gene expression associated with inflammation, IFN response, and myeloid cell trafficking occurred, and lymphocyte-specific transcripts decreased. These alterations were corroborated by marked serum inflammatory cytokine elevations and egress of circulating lymphocytes. Responses of vaccinees with preexisting adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) neutralizing antibodies were strongly attenuated, suggesting that enhanced HIV acquisition in Ad5-seropositive subgroups in the Step Study may relate to the lack of appropriate innate activation rather than to increased systemic immune activation. Importantly, patterns of chemoattractant cytokine responses at 24 h and alterations in 209 peripheral blood mononuclear cell transcripts at 72 h were predictive of subsequent induction and magnitude of HIV-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses.

Within 24 h, striking increases in peripheral blood mononuclear cell gene expression associated with inflammation, IFN response, and myeloid cell trafficking occurred, and lymphocyte-specific transcripts decreased. These alterations were corroborated by marked serum inflammatory cytokine elevations and egress of circulating lymphocytes. Responses of vaccinees with preexisting adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) neutralizing antibodies were strongly attenuated, suggesting that enhanced HIV acquisition in Ad5-seropositive subgroups in the Step Study may relate to the lack of appropriate innate activation rather than to increased systemic immune activation. Importantly, patterns of chemoattractant cytokine responses at 24 h and alterations in 209 peripheral blood mononuclear cell transcripts at 72 h were predictive of subsequent induction and magnitude of HIV-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses. This systems approach provides a framework to compare innate responses induced by vectors, as shown here by contrasting the more rapid, robust response to MRKAd5/HIV with that to yellow fever vaccine. When applied iteratively, the findings may permit selection of HIV vaccine candidates eliciting innate immune response profiles more likely to drive HIV protective immunity.","Genes down-regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cell 1d vs 0d in adults (20-50) after exposure to MRKAd5 HIV-1 gag/pol/nef , time point 1D.

Within 24 h, striking increases in peripheral blood mononuclear cell gene expression associated with inflammation, IFN response, and myeloid cell trafficking occurred, and lymphocyte-specific transcripts decreased. These alterations were corroborated by marked serum inflammatory cytokine elevations and egress of circulating lymphocytes. Responses of vaccinees with preexisting adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) neutralizing antibodies were strongly attenuated, suggesting that enhanced HIV acquisition in Ad5-seropositive subgroups in the Step Study may relate to the lack of appropriate innate activation rather than to increased systemic immune activation. Importantly, patterns of chemoattractant cytokine responses at 24 h and alterations in 209 peripheral blood mononuclear cell transcripts at 72 h were predictive of subsequent induction and magnitude of HIV-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses. This systems approach provides a framework to compare innate responses induced by vectors, as shown here by contrasting the more rapid, robust response to MRKAd5/HIV with that to yellow fever vaccine. When applied iteratively, the findings may permit selection of HIV vaccine candidates eliciting innate immune response profiles more likely to drive HIV protective immunity.","Genes up-regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cell 1d vs 0d in adults (20-50) after exposure to MRKAd5 HIV-1 gag/pol/nef , time point 1D.

Modified vaccinia virus Ankara expressing antigen 85A (MVA85A) is a novel tuberculosis vaccine candidate designed to enhance responses induced by BCG. Antigen-specific interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production is greatly enhanced by MVA85A, however the variability between healthy individuals is extensive. In this study we have sought to characterize the early changes in gene expression in humans following vaccination with MVA85A and relate these to long-term immunogenicity. Two days post-vaccination, MVA85A induces a strong interferon and inflammatory response. Separating volunteers into high and low responders on the basis of T cell responses to 85A peptides measured during the trial, an expansion of circulating CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ cells is seen in low but not high responders. Additionally, high levels of Toll-like Receptor (TLR) 1 on day of vaccination are associated with an increased response to antigen 85A. In a classification model, combined expression levels of TLR1, TICAM2 and CD14 on day of vaccination and CTLA4 and IL2Ralpha two days post-vaccination can classify high and low responders with over 80% accuracy. Furthermore, administering MVA85A in mice with anti-TLR2 antibodies may abrogate high responses, and neutralising antibodies to TLRs 1, 2 or 6 or HMGB1 decrease CXCL2 production during in vitro stimulation with MVA85A. HMGB1 is released into the supernatant following atimulation with MVA85A and we propose this signal may be the trigger activating the TLR pathway. This study suggests an important role for an endogenous ligand in innate sensing of MVA and demonstrates the importance of pattern recognition receptors and regulatory T cell responses in determining the magnitude of the antigen specific immune response to vaccination with MVA85A in humans.","Genes up-regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cell 2d vs 0d in adult (18-55) after exposure to Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) virus vaccine vector , time point 2D","Matsumiya M,Stylianou E,Griffiths K,Lang Z,Meyer J,Harris SA,Rowland R,Minassian AM,Pathan AA,Fletcher H,McShane H",23844129,HUMAN_GENE_SYMBOL,"ACP2,APOBEC3A,BCL2A1,BID,BST2,C3AR1,CARD16,CASP1,CCL2,CCL3,CCL3L1,CCL4,,CCL7,CCL8,CD68,CFD,CTSL,CXCL10,DNASE2,DRAM1,EIF2AK2,FCGR1A,FCGR1BP,FPR2,FPR3,GLMP,ICAM1,IFI27,IFI35,IFI44,IFI44L,IFI6,IFIH1,IFIT1,IFIT2,IFIT3,IFITM2,IFITM3,IL1A,IL4I1,IL6,IRF9,ISG15,LGALS9,MARCO,MX1,PARP9,PILRA,PSMB9,PYCARD,RNASE2,RSAD2,S100A8,S100A9,SERPING1,SLC15A3,SRC,STAT1,TICAM2,TLR1,TLR6,TLR8,TNF,TNFSF10,TYMP,XAF1",67,"ACP2,APOBEC3A,BCL2A1,BID,BST2,C3AR1,CARD16,CASP1,CCL2,CCL3,CCL3L1,CCL4,CCL4L1,CCL7,CCL8,CD68,CFD,CTSL1,CXCL10,DNASE2,DRAM1,EIF2AK2,FCGR1A,FCGR1B,FPR2,FPR3,GLMP,ICAM1,IFI27,IFI35,IFI44,IFI44L,IFI6,IFIH1,IFIT1,IFIT2,IFIT3,IFITM2,IFITM3,IL1A,IL4I1,IL6,IRF9,ISG15,LGALS9,MARCO,MX1,PARP9,PILRA,PSMB9,PYCARD,RNASE2,RSAD2,S100A8,S100A9,SERPING1,SLC15A3,SRC,STAT1,TICAM2,TLR1,TLR6,TLR8,TNF,TNFSF10,TYMP,XAF1",C7:VAX,HIPC SIGNATURES,NIAID/HIPC SIGNATURES,Suppl Table IV,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2701477/bin/NIHMS83712-supplement-Suplementary_t.doc,NA,NA,NA,NA

Within 24 h, striking increases in peripheral blood mononuclear cell gene expression associated with inflammation, IFN response, and myeloid cell trafficking occurred, and lymphocyte-specific transcripts decreased. These alterations were corroborated by marked serum inflammatory cytokine elevations and egress of circulating lymphocytes. Responses of vaccinees with preexisting adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) neutralizing antibodies were strongly attenuated, suggesting that enhanced HIV acquisition in Ad5-seropositive subgroups in the Step Study may relate to the lack of appropriate innate activation rather than to increased systemic immune activation. Importantly, patterns of chemoattractant cytokine responses at 24 h and alterations in 209 peripheral blood mononuclear cell transcripts at 72 h were predictive of subsequent induction and magnitude of HIV-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses. This systems approach provides a framework to compare innate responses induced by vectors, as shown here by contrasting the more rapid, robust response to MRKAd5/HIV with that to yellow fever vaccine.

We used a systems vaccinology approach to identify early innate immune correlates of antibody induction in humans receiving the Ebola vaccine rVSV-ZEBOV. Blood samples from days 0, 1, 3, 7, and 14 were analyzed for changes in cytokine levels, innate immune cell subsets, and gene expression. Integrative statistical analyses with cross-validation identified a signature of 5 early innate markers correlating with antibody titers on day 28 and beyond. Among those, IP-10 on day 3 and MFI of CXCR6 on NK cells on day 1 were independent correlates. Consistently, we found an early gene expression signature linked to IP-10. This comprehensive characterization of early innate immune responses to the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine in humans revealed immune signatures linked to IP-10. These results suggest correlates of vaccine-induced antibody induction and provide a rationale to explore strategies for augmenting the effectiveness of vaccines through manipulation of IP-10.","Genes up-regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cell 1d vs 0d in adults (18-55) after exposure to rVSV-ZEBOV , time point 1D","Rechtien A,Richert L,Lorenzo H,Martrus G,Hejblum B,Dahlke C,Kasonta R,Zinser M,Stubbe H,Matschl U,Lohse A,Krähling V,Eickmann M,Becker S,VEBCON Consortium,Thiébaut R,Altfeld M,Addo MM",28854372,HUMAN_GENE_SYMBOL,"CCL2,CXCL10,HERC5,IFIT1,ISG15,LAMP3,NFKB1,NFKB2,RSAD2,USP18",10,"CCL2,CXCL10,HERC5,IFIT1,ISG15,LAMP3,NFKB1,NFKB2,RSAD2,USP18",C7:VAX,HIPC SIGNATURES,NIAID/HIPC SIGNATURES,S6 Dataset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4338067/bin/pone.0118528.s006.xlsx,NA,NA,NA,NA

Modified vaccinia virus Ankara expressing antigen 85A (MVA85A) is a novel tuberculosis vaccine candidate designed to enhance responses induced by BCG. Antigen-specific interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production is greatly enhanced by MVA85A, however the variability between healthy individuals is extensive. In this study we have sought to characterize the early changes in gene expression in humans following vaccination with MVA85A and relate these to long-term immunogenicity. Two days post-vaccination, MVA85A induces a strong interferon and inflammatory response. Separating volunteers into high and low responders on the basis of T cell responses to 85A peptides measured during the trial, an expansion of circulating CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ cells is seen in low but not high responders. Additionally, high levels of Toll-like Receptor (TLR) 1 on day of vaccination are associated with an increased response to antigen 85A. In a classification model, combined expression levels of TLR1, TICAM2 and CD14 on day of vaccination and CTLA4 and IL2Ralpha two days post-vaccination can classify high and low responders with over 80% accuracy. Furthermore, administering MVA85A in mice with anti-TLR2 antibodies may abrogate high responses, and neutralising antibodies to TLRs 1, 2 or 6 or HMGB1 decrease CXCL2 production during in vitro stimulation with MVA85A. HMGB1 is released into the supernatant following atimulation with MVA85A and we propose this signal may be the trigger activating the TLR pathway. This study suggests an important role for an endogenous ligand in innate sensing of MVA and demonstrates the importance of pattern recognition receptors and regulatory T cell responses in determining the magnitude of the antigen specific immune response to vaccination with MVA85A in humans.","Genes up-regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cell vaccinated vs control in adults (18-55) (treated in vitro with MVA85A) after exposure to Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) virus vaccine vector , time point 6H","Matsumiya M,Stylianou E,Griffiths K,Lang Z,Meyer J,Harris SA,Rowland R,Minassian AM,Pathan AA,Fletcher H,McShane H",23844129,HUMAN_GENE_SYMBOL,"ABCG4,ADAP1,ADM,AGFG2,AK4,ANP32C,ANPEP,ANXA5,AP2B1,AQP9,ARMCX1,BAG3,BCL11A,IRF2BPL,C15orf48,SLX9,GET4,CCL2,CCL3L1,CD14,CD200,CD63,CD8B,CDK14,COL11A2,CTSL,CUX1,CXCL1,CYP1B1,DDR1,DNAJB5,DTNBP1,EXT1,EZH2,FAM170B,FCGRT,FGR,FTL,HAX1,H4C4,HLX,IER3,IFNB1,IL1RN,IL4I1,SLC7A5P2,ITGAX,ITPRIPL2,URB2,KLF4,KYNU,,LSM12,LYL1,LYN,MASP2,MFSD2A,MRTFA,MTMR11,NCF2,NOTCH2NLA,NR4A3,NUTF2,OR12D3,OR2A14,OSGEP,P2RX4,PLAUR,PLEK,PLEKHA4,PMS2CL,PPP3R1,PREP,NECTIN2,RANBP3L,RBM47,RHOU,RMRP,RPP14,RRAD,RSPRY1,SDC4,SLC2A1,SLC43A3,SOD2,SPRYD3,SRC,STAT3,TAGLN,TBC1D10A,TGFBI,THBS1,TP73-AS1,ZC3H12C,ZNF395",95,"ABCG4,ADAP1,ADM,AGFG2,AK3L1,ANP32C,ANPEP,ANXA5,AP2B1,AQP9,ARMCX1,BAG3,BCL11A,C14orf4,C15orf48,C21orf70,C7orf20,CCL2,CCL3L1,CD14,CD200,CD63,CD8B,CDK14,COL11A2,CTSL1,CUX1,CXCL1,CYP1B1,DDR1,DNAJB5,DTNBP1,EXT1,EZH2,FAM170B,FCGRT,FGR,FTL,HAX1,HIST1H4D,HLX,IER3,IFNB1,IL1RN,IL4I1,IMAA,ITGAX,ITPRIPL2,KIAA0133,KLF4,KYNU,LINCR,LSM12,LYL1,LYN,MASP2,MFSD2,MKL1,MTMR11,NCF2,NOTCH2NL,NR4A3,NUTF2,OR12D3,OR2A14,OSGEP,P2RX4,PLAUR,PLEK,PLEKHA4,PMS2CL,PPP3R1,PREP,PVRL2,RANBP3L,RBM47,RHOU,RMRP,RPP14,RRAD,RSPRY1,SDC4,SLC2A1,SLC43A3,SOD2,SPRYD3,SRC,STAT3,TAGLN,TBC1D10A,TGFBI,THBS1,TP73-AS1,ZC3H12C,ZNF395",C7:VAX,HIPC SIGNATURES,NIAID/HIPC SIGNATURES,"Suppl mat, 2016HV0244R-s01.xlsx",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5287313/bin/khvi-13-01-1227900-s001.zip,NA,NA,NA,NA

Results of the first Phase 2b efficacy trial of a candidate vaccine, MVA85A, evaluated in BCG-vaccinated infants were published last year. Although no improvement in efficacy above BCG alone was seen, cryopreserved samples from this trial provide an opportunity to study the immune response to vaccination in this population. METHODS: We investigated blood samples taken before vaccination (baseline) and one and 28 days post-vaccination with MVA85A or placebo (Candin). The IFN-gamma ELISpot assay was performed at baseline and on day 28 to quantify the adaptive response to Ag85A peptides. Gene expression analysis was performed at all three timepoints to identify early gene signatures predictive of the magnitude of the subsequent adaptive T cell response using the significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) statistical package and gene set enrichment analysis. RESULTS: One day post-MVA85A, there is an induction of inflammatory pathways compared to placebo samples. Modules associated with myeloid cells and inflammation pre- and one day post-MVA85A correlate with a higher IFN-gamma ELISpot response post-vaccination. By contrast, previous work done in UK adults shows early inflammation in this population is not associated with a strong T cell response but that induction of regulatory pathways inversely correlates with the magnitude of the T cell response. This may be indicative of important mechanistic differences in how T cell responses develop in these two populations following vaccination with MVA85A. CONCLUSION: The results suggest the capacity of MVA85A to induce a strong innate response is key to the initiation of an adaptive immune response in South African infants but induction of regulatory pathways may be more important in UK adults.
