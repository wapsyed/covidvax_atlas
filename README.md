# Abstract: 
The rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines has played a crucial role in mitigating its public health impact. However, a gene-level understanding of immune system dynamics during vaccination is crucial for comprehending the various vaccination scenarios, including infection. In this study, we conducted an integrative analysis of immunological transcriptomic profiles to delineate the impact of COVID-19 vaccination on immune responses. Our analysis comprised 681 bulk RNAseq samples from 343 participants, including healthy individuals vaccinated with different types of COVID-19 vaccines (inactivated virus, protein subunit, viral-vectored, and mRNA), along with infected patients with or without prior vaccination history. We identified distinct and overlapping immune-related genes and pathways associated with COVID-19 vaccination and infection, considering time and regimen. Furthermore, we expanded our analysis to include datasets from vaccines targeting other pathogens, such as influenza, smallpox, and yellow fever. Additionally, we introduce VaxGO, a novel tool for exploring immunological processes and comparing them across different vaccines. Our work will contribute to advancing our understanding of the immunological mechanisms underlying Covid-19 vaccination and inform future developments in vaccine design and personalized medicine.
