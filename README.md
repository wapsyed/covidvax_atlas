# Abstract: 
In this comprehensive study, we explore the landscape of COVID-19 vaccination, which comprises a wide variety of vaccines and platforms. This atlas elucidates the transcriptional signatures among these vaccines and compares them with natural infection, considering prior vaccination and infection status. Moreover, we present a comparative analysis of immune-related genes within COVID-19 vaccination datasets and extend to non-related vaccine datasets. With an integrated approach, this work describes  transcriptional responses, paving the way for a comprehensive comprehension of COVID-19 vaccination dynamics and their immunological implications.Furthermore, we introduce VaxGO, a tool for immunological exploration of vaccination data.
