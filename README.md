# Abstract: 
The COVID-19 vaccinations have played a significant role in controlling the pandemic. To elucidate their impact on the immune system, a COVID-19 vaccination atlas was developed through an integrative systems vaccinology approach. The atlas includes both healthy individuals and those infected with or without prior vaccination, and covers the administration of five vaccines in different regimens: Covilo®, Zifivax®, Vaxzebria® or Covishield®, Spikevax®, and Comirnaty®. Key markers were identified to distinguish between different vaccine types and infections including LHFPL2, FYN, TYMP, JUP, SERINC5, KIT, and GRAMD1C. Finally, we described the immunological landscape of COVID-19 vaccines and vaccines against other pathogens, in gene-level and in cell population dynamics.
